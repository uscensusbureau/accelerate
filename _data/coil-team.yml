  title: Content Advisor
  bio: <p>I'm <strong>Victoria</strong>, a Content Advisor for COIL. Born in Los Angeles, I've lived and worked in dozens of countries and am now happily settled back in Ventura, California. I've made a career of using storytelling and digital media strategy to make socially important messages go viral and have led the growth of media companies at Upworthy, Slate, Huffington Post and elsewhere. Now I do the same through my own agency, Finally, for for nonprofits, fortune 500 companies and of course, the Census! I've my career traveling while working, which included sailing around the East Coast and the Caribbean, and living in Puerto Rico during and after hurricane Maria. So, AMA about remote work, where to go for your next vacation and what to pack in a disaster go-bag. Lastly, I believe everything doing is also worth bringing your whole self to. That means that for me, no workday is complete without having a bit of fun and a good laugh and how seriously we're all taking ourselves. My colleague and life partner is an ornery Chihuahua-mix named Honey Dog who never pulls her weight in our shared home office.  </p>

I worked with TOP in 2017 while finishing up a degree in Information Systems at UT Austin, briefly entertained the idea of tech consulting, and came back to COIL to do something I love with people I enjoy working with.

I'm based out of Houston, TX with the cutest coworker ever, Captain. </p>

  title: Civic Digital Fellow
  bio: <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Jamie</strong> and I am a 2019 Civic Digital Fellow. I grew up in Fremont, California and I currently live in Los Angeles, California as a full-time student at the University of Southern California. I am a rising junior majoring in Media Arts and Practice in the School of Cinematic Arts. My interests lie in the intersection of technology, design, and social change — hopefully in the civic tech space. In the future, I hope to use AR and VR as a diplomatic or journalistic tool in creating immersive experiences that encourage empathy through multi-media narratives and informative storytelling. Specifically, I am interested in issues revolving around inequities in education, the Asian American identity, homelessness, and sustainability within the fashion industry. Both on and off campus, I apply my design skills to a plethora of projects from a medication-tracking mobile application under Code the Change to a group microlending system that empowers Kenyan women to build financial independence. During my free time, I enjoy working with any form of visual media from darkroom photography to wheel throwing, running, thrifting, and tending to my plant collection.</p>

I'm excited to be joining COIL this summer as a Software Engineering Civic Digital Fellow! I'm an East Coast native, originally from Edison, NJ, now living in DC. I've meandered through computer science, architecture, design and law and am exploring questions of how technology and infrastructure mediates our access to civil liberties. As our lives grow increasingly digital, how do we contextualize our shifting cultural and social norms? I also love dogs, cooking, and climbing (though I'm not great at it) and am so thrilled to be working in public service on a team as thoughtful and exciting our ours.</p>
