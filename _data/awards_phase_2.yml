    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to improve the commercial viability of technology that enables the real time measurement and control of landfill gas extraction systems. It has the potential to improve the economics of the Landfill Gas to Energy (LFG-E) market and reduce the environmental impact of landfills. With industry-wide implementation, annual revenues from existing LFG-E projects could be increased by over $450 million. The additional energy produced would power over 350,000 homes. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas (GHG), and the EPA estimates that in 2011, emissions from landfills accounted for nearly 17.5% of generation from all manmade sources in the US. The associated reduction in GHG emissions from improved landfill gas collection would be equivalent to the emissions of over 3.6 billion gallons of gasoline or 76 million barrels of oil. Furthermore, because of the improved economics, this Phase II project could encourage the development of new LFG-E projects, further expanding the size and value of this market. According to EPA estimates, currently undeveloped sites could account for an additional 850 MW of power generation, enough to power over 508,000 homes.

    The technical objectives of the project are 1) to reduce the cost of various system components, and 2) to address new product requirements related to third party safety and other certifications that are demanded by the market. The approach to cost reduction is to replace several commercially available off-the-shelf components (specifically, NDIR gas sensors and an electrically-actuated control valve) with custom designed alternatives that can meet product functional requirements at a 30% reduction in cost. In order to achieve the certifications that are demanded by the market it will be necessary to define the specific standards and protection concepts that are applicable, and then re-engineer hardware in accordance with these standards. This will involve a combination of component substitution and system re-design, depending on the specific protection concept(s) and hazardous location classification that are identified. The research will build upon the reliability and product functionality improvements that were a key outcome of the Phase I project, and successful completion of the research goals will enable more widespread adoption of real time control technology in the landfill gas industry.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will be the discovery of new ionization technology for use with mass spectrometry.  This technology will enable lower cost, lower energy use, and reduced user expertise, which may potentially drive mass spectrometry into large and underserved markets such as medical diagnostics and field portable instruments designed specifically for use in homeland security, bedside diagnostics, or bio-threat detection. The new technology changes the current understanding of ionization processes used in mass spectrometry and provides opportunities for new innovations to advance science through improved measurements, impacting fields such as health, safety, and security. The aims of this Phase II project are to develop interfaces to incorporate the platform developed in Phase I on most major mass spectrometer manufacturer's instruments and to develop technologies for rapid automate analyses even of surfaces.  The research of Phase II is aimed to better understand the fundamentals of this new technology in order to drive commercial success in high sensitivity rapid analyses at a competitive price. Mass spectrometers are widely used representing a $4 billion industry of which ionization technology represents a significant commercial opportunity.

    This STTR Phase II project proposes to revolutionize ionization in mass spectrometry by providing commercial products that utilize a simple and powerful ionization technology. The newly discovered process spontaneously converts large and small, volatile and nonvolatile compounds to the gas-phase ions necessary for analysis using mass spectrometry without employing currently used high cost lasers or high voltage. The method is broadly applicable for analysis of compounds such as drugs, lipids, carbohydrate conjugates, peptides, and proteins directly from bodily fluids or tissue, as well as synthetic polymers and inorganic catalytic surfaces.  This technology is anticipated to augment or even replace older ionization methods in applications such as clinical analyses, pharmaceuticals, forensics, environmental, and food safety. The aims of the Phase II project are to implement the multifunctional platform developed during Phase I on a variety of manufacturer's instruments, automate the process to allow lower cost and faster analyses, and provide an automated surface analysis platform.  Besides determining the best sample preparation methodologies and choice of solvents/matrices, the research objectives include innovative automated sample introduction technologies that eliminate the need for a conventional "ion source" while reducing the pumping requirements, which currently hinder development of small, low-cost portable mass spectrometers.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Business Innovation
    Research Phase II project is to commercialize Pyrochem Catalyst Company's (PCC)
    catalyst materials.   These catalyst materials are unique in that the catalytically
    active metal is atomically dispersed in a rigid crystalline matrix.  This imparts
    unparalleled thermal stability, even at temperatures in excess of 1000°C.  Conventional
    catalysts typically require much higher precious metal loadings (as much as 20
    times) to achieve the same activity as the materials developed in this project
    and at high temperatures those active metals can agglomerate into large clusters
    reducing their performance and the lifetime of the catalyst.  The series of catalysts
    developed in this project are designed in a way that all precious metal is optimally
    utilized and protected.  This includes resistance from sulfur poisoning and the
    accumulation of carbon when operating under severe conditions.  This makes these
    materials ideal for high temperature processes such as steam methane reforming
    for hydrogen generation, autothermal reforming for syngas production, syngas generation
    in oxygen transport membranes (OTM), and exhaust oxidation in automotive catalytic
    convertors.     \n\nThe objectives of this Phase II STTR program are to build
    on the success of the Phase I objectives that developed a low cost and continuous
    catalyst manufacturing method for producing the pyrochlore powders that are the
    basis for the proposed catalyst product.  The method may be equally effective
    for producing other types of mixed metal oxides like perovskites and fluorites.
    In Phase II, PCC will construct and test a scaled-up production platform, following
    the design elements of the proof of concept demonstrated in Phase I.  The new
    unit will be designed to manufacture proprietary pyrochlore powders at a rate
    with a hundred-fold increase over production rates of the Phase I unit.  The Phase
    II technical efforts also examine a range of catalyst synthesis parameters like
    oxidant gas concentration/composition, temperature distribution in the production
    unit, precursor residence times, synthesis solution chemistry, and optimizing
    heat and mass transport.  Through a subaward, powders produced from the process
    will be characterized and tested for activity by the National Energy Technology
    Labs, Morgantown, WV.  The overall goal of this project is the development of
    a high throughput / high yield manufacturing process that produces high performance
    catalysts for commercial sale."

    to develop a handheld, one-step paper-based device for rapid self-testing of sexually
    transmitted infections. The company aims to replace lab-based assays for Chlamydia
    trachomatis (CT) and expand testing access to previously unreachable settings.
    The technology combines the ease-of-use and very low cost of rapid point-of-care
    (POC) diagnostics with the high accuracy of lab-based tests, enabling unprecedented
    reliability at the POC and at home. CT infection is one of the most prevalent
    STIs in the US. An estimated three million new cases occur each year with direct
    annual medical costs of greater than $3.5 billion. Untreated CT, symptomatic or
    not, may cause long term pregnancy complications, even infertility. Traditional
    lab-based CT assays prevent the ability to test-and-treat within one patient visit.
    This delay results in a high number of cases that do not get treatment due to
    loss-to-follow up (especially for young STI patients) and increased infection
    transmission. Phase Diagnostics? novel device will be: (1) Fast: Results to the
    patient in less than 15 minutes; (2) Affordable: Costs less than $1 to manufacture;
    (3) Accurate: Sensitivity and specificity on par with lab-based assays; (4) Convenient:
    Handheld with no required equipment or training. \n\nThe key innovation of the
    company's novel device is to use aqueous two-phase systems (ATPSs) to selectively
    pre-concentrate the pathogenic bacteria prior to detection, thereby dramatically
    enhancing the accuracy of conventional rapid LFA POC technology and enabling the
    use of urine samples for the detection of CT. During Phase I, the company was
    able to adapt ATPS to urine medium, attain improved limits of detection of its
    system and make considerable progress in fully integrating all components into
    a true one-step paper microfluidic strip. The objective of Phase II is to fully
    develop the company's proposed device to be ready for FDA 510(k) clearance and
    CLIA waiver enabling clinical studies. The company will first complete the product
    optimization work initiated in Phase I and perform additional device robustness
    studies. As these experiments near completion, the company will work with a contract
    prototyper to design and develop prototypes based on the final optimized device
    components. At the same time, the company will establish small scale manufacturing
    processes to ensure that it can generate a reproducible pilot batch. The company
    will then perform Alpha and Beta product testing to determine the clinical performance
    of its prototype as well as obtain feedback from end-users to determine areas
    for optimization."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project evaluates the feasibility of constructing vivid, full-color, reflective display modules for large-area outdoor digital signage driven by dielectric elastomers suitable for pilot testing.  Completion of Phase II objectives is expected to have the following impact:  Commercially, the availability of new signage products will create significant economic impact through partial capture of the $14.2B domestic billboard and sign manufacturing market.  Up to 10% of US zoning codes are estimated to prohibit LED-based (light emitting diode) signage while potentially permitting a reflective digital signage technology, expanding the domestic market up to $5.6B, with a 10x impact worldwide.  Environmentally, greenhouse gas reduction is expected as an alternative to LED-based technology; up to 40x reduction in energy consumption is anticipated relative to LEDs. Additionally, billboard wrap waste will be reduced by replacing printed signage. Scientifically, the use of dielectric elastomers as a class of materials in products would be promoted through addressing technological and manufacturing hurdles currently limiting market translation. Societally, increased impact from timely public service announcements on digital billboards displayed during natural disasters, when catching fugitives from the FBI?s Most Wanted lists, and with Amber/Silver alerts are expected through large-area digital sign proliferation.

    In phase II, electroactive polymer-based proof-of-concept display modules will be constructed and tested, ready for pilot testing with initial customers.  The low-cost display design uses unique electro-hydraulic driving principles to enable exceptional refractive index matching within the optical stack for highly vivid and reflective full-color generation.  In phase I, a functional proof-of-concept pixel array module was fabricated using scalable processes.  To achieve pilot readiness, improvements in performance, resolution, and calibration to meet advertiser standards are needed, as well as environmental qualification for outdoor operation, development of industry-conscious software control, and qualification of supply chain inputs to enable further production at scale.  Phase II research will address these technical challenges by introducing process refinements and quality control standards, conduct color calibration using existing techniques, perform industry-relevant environmental testing, work with vendors to source soft-tooled components, and develop module and multi-module control software.  The result of phase II efforts will be a calibrated and rugged one square foot, full-color, 16mm pitch, reflective display module ready for scaling to pilot production following phase II.

    develop a technology to transform swine manure into sustainable alternatives for
    petroleum-based adhesives, with a first opportunity in the asphalt market.  This
    project builds on a successful Phase I effort as well as a prior Innovation Corps
    award. The major socio-economic impact of the technology will be in rural areas,
    as it will allow pig farmers to alleviate the burden of manure management and
    create a new revenue stream.  This project also offers a novel approach to develop
    low-cost, durable, and eco-friendly construction adhesives, reduce the cost associated
    with manure management and lagoon maintenance, create new manufacturing and engineering
    jobs, and reduce our dependence on petroleum resources. Current practices for
    handling manure release carbon to the atmosphere, either from manure storage or
    anaerobic digestion of manure. In contrast, the proposed technology sequesters
    carbon in bio-adhesives, while passing nutrients to the effluents, bio-char, and
    grey water, which can then be used as fertilizer.  The Phase I research results
    have shown that bio-adhesive is more durable, lower in cost ($0.50/gallon, as
    compared with $2.00/gallon) and more eco-friendly (lower volatile organic compound
    levels) than many petroleum-based adhesives.\n \nThe core technology to be developed
    further in this effort uses thermochemical liquefaction to convert swine manure
    to bio-oil, followed by the polymerization of bio-oil to produce bio-adhesives.
    This technology will eventually enable use of the six billion gallons of swine
    manure that are generated annually in the U.S. to supply about 88 million barrels
    of bio-adhesive.  As a result of the Phase I effort, a study of the effects of
    heating rate on the yield and quality of bio-adhesive was completed; this in turn,
    helped ensure that the conversion process takes place successfully, thereby addressing
    one of the main scale-up challenges. The resulting data were used as an input
    for the design of a pilot bio-reactor, including central heaters and a heat exchanger.
    \ After the design phase, the team began the fabrication and assembly of this
    bio-reactor, and followed up with multiple trials.  In the Phase II project, building
    on these successful trials, we will complete the troubleshooting of the bio-reactor
    while finalizing the design and construction of the oil separation and polymerization
    column, and sampling valves.  These items will permit a fully-realized pilot plant
    by the end of this project."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project presents novel technology to fabricate dry, removable, reusable adhesives based on aligned polymeric nanofibers using scalable electrospinning methodologies.  This new approach offers the potential advantages of significantly lower costs and easier scale-up using nozzle-free nanofiber spinning processes. Dry reusable adhesives as a replacement for messy liquid glues will improve product safety and reduce environmental impact. Removable and reusable adhesive tapes and labels will also eliminate waste and facilitate product recycling. The resulting products will have strong shear adhesion and easy peel, leading to broad application with a wide range of substrates like glass, metal, wall board, and plastics. Proof-of-concept samples have confirmed market-driven value propositions. The Phase II project will develop commercial products and applications for consumer and industrial applications, for automotive assembly systems, for decorative wall murals, and for medical device and health care uses. Fiber spinning and collection techniques will be engineered to improve product performance, reduce costs and improve scalability of the manufacturing process.

    The Phase I project has confirmed proof-of-concept dry adhesive samples with shear adhesion strengths exceeding 20 N/cm2 in dynamic mode and 45 N/cm2 in dead weight mode.  The resulting samples have low peel strength and are reusable. In Phase II, the electrospinning process will be optimized using novel polymer blend systems to achieve performance targets for specific customer product development. The nozzleless electrospinning process will be scaled to the pilot level for product testing and to provide the engineering design basis for commercial manufacture. A continuous roll-to-roll process to produce aligned nanofibers will break new ground in the electrospinning industry.  New applications in medical devices have been proposed by strategic partners to capitalize on the self-adhesion properties of these materials.  Dry adhesive applicator systems will be developed to allow the aligned adhesive nanofibers to conform to surface asperities. With the Phase I success of proof-of-concept prototypes, the Phase II effort will move the development of aligned nanofiber dry adhesives into the market introduction phase in preparation for commercial manufacture and sales.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is focused on establishing full-scale production parameters, quality control procedures, operational testing and commercialization of cutting-edge compartmentalized vacuum composites. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in cold chain shipping, storage, building insulation, automobiles, aerospace and other advanced markets. The first application is in the cold chain shipping industry, for packaging and storage of temperature sensitive materials. A new generation of thin (less than 1"), light weight, highly insulated (R value 25-30), durable, and long service life boxes will meet a critical need in this area. Temperature-sensitive products such as vaccines, blood, organs, and diagnostic specimens are shipped using insulated containers, and the new materials to be developed will permit longer shipping duration, higher impact resistance, and re-usability. The cold chain shipping market includes the Red Cross, blood banks, pharmacies, clinical trial shippers, diagnostic centers, life science material providers and whole sale distributors. The annual United States market potential in life sciences packaging is estimated at $291 million.  The resulting materials also have significant potential for uses in permanent and temporary structures, and in a variety of transportation applications.

    Successful completion of the Phase I work has resulted in cost-effective (an order of magnitude lower expected cost), stronger (ten times the impact resistance of Styrofoam), lightweight, thin (less than 1"), highly-insulating (R 16-22), compartmentalized vacuum composite materials.  An exclusive machining capability was also demonstrated, whereby vacuum composites can be cut and sized on-site without degradation in thermal performance, an issue which affects current vacuum insulation panels (VIPs).  Optimization of the developed composites to achieve targeted insulation rating, cost, and service life characteristics will be conducted during Phase II. Thermal performance, mechanical characteristics and operational performance will be evaluated for their application in cold chain shipping and in building/structural insulation. The team will also validate boxes fabricated using these materials in cold chain shipping to verify safe transportation of blood products, organs, and/or pharmaceuticals.  Based on the Phase II work, it is anticipated that these materials will be poised to replace petroleum-based foam materials and vacuum insulation panels as a high-performance and economical solution in these markets.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase II project is to deliver a bio-based and functionally improved optical polymer that can be made into a lens. The lens product has commercial applications in rapidly growing mass-markets like Prescription eyewear that is growing significantly due to onslaught of myopia. Using scientific data, this proposal demonstrates an improved commercial product for myopia when compared to Polycarbonate, the most popular eyewear material in US. Work proposed in Phase II focuses on development of the polymer at large scale and its conversion to lenses using a lower-cost, one-step molding process that can also reduce current industry wastages by as much as an estimated 90%. For establishing suitability of the product towards commercial applications, the Phase II goals include product testing in lab as well as with real subjects to generate marketable data.  Finished prescription lenses are a ~$30 billion plus market, with ~70% of lens sales serving myopic patients, who will see a tremendous benefit from using our ultra-clear lens. Broader impact of this technology proposal is to make eyeglasses exponentially more affordable in contrast to today's high costs. Price controls exerted by market monopolies like Luxottica and Essilor on finished lenses pose a huge barrier to base of pyramid markets. Our easy-to-make lens technology simplifies the eyewear supply chain for benefit of these unconventional markets and can lower costs dramatically for billions of people around the world, who are separated by a pair of glasses from otherwise blindness.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to leverage properties of sugars to build an optically clear, transparent polymer of good refractive index, low dispersion and low density. In commercial applications of this polymer as a prescription lens, it thus represents a state-of-the-art product that combines the best properties of various incumbent eyewear materials into one.  A key intellectual merit of this SBIR project is to achieve a plastic with optical properties similar to glass, a gold standard in optical materials. Our chemistry platform is 90% bio-based, a unique value proposition in prescription lens industry, where use of extremely toxic and hazardous chemicals is common. Phase I work has also led to the development of a novel route of manufacturing lenses which can lower cost barriers for setting up optical labs, expedite the process for making prescription lenses and cut wastages in current prescription industry. In Phase II, our goal is to methodically develop the process for making lenses using Novol's polymers and obtain data to translate the proposed technology to a commercially preferred lens product with special benefits to myopic patients.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project extends to industry stakeholders holding financial
    interests that are impacted by climate change. Climate change has a scientifically
    evident impact on the intensity, duration, and frequency of extreme weather events.
    It has become imperative for organizations in all sectors to gain a clear understanding
    of the impacts of climate change on their business so as to inform strategic planning
    and risk management strategies. Those in the risk transfer industry, in particular
    reinsurance companies, are the most likely early adopters given their technical
    sophistication and their increasing and acute awareness of the financial impacts
    climate change now has on their bottom line. Thus, the company's goal is to penetrate
    the reinsurance industry as an entry point to the more broadly defined risk transfer
    industry. Subsequently, the company will utilize the platform to address problems
    in agricultural investment, real estate investment, and energy planning - all
    sectors that will be adversely impacted by climate change in specific, well-defined
    ways. The adaptation in each of these sectors is vital to the well-being and prosperity
    of the ultimate stakeholder: the American taxpayer. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation
    Research Phase II project aims to harness industry knowledge and expand on the
    technical work conducted during the company's Phase I project, with the objective
    of building a modular software platform generalizable to multiple key climate
    change hazards and extensible to other strategically identified sectors. The knowledge
    gathered via customer discovery interviews in Phase I will serve as a guide for
    product development. The technical work completed in Phase I, in particular extreme
    precipitation modeling under climate change and its application to the risk transfer
    sector, will serve as a foundation for expansion into the modeling of additional
    hazards. There are currently no tools available that integrate climate change
    informatics into risk management at scale. The company aims to address this problem
    through the translation of physics-guided statistical modeling to a commercial
    software platform. Upon conclusion of the Phase II project, the company expects
    to have a completed product that will house data on additional hazards exacerbated
    by climate change, with applications in the agriculture, commercial real estate,
    and the energy sectors. The company will show product value through sector-tailored
    software demonstrations and case studies that demonstrate return on investment
    to be realized by using this platform.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory
    mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's

     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance a novel probe-based direct transfer (PBDT) printing technology for manufacturing flexible hybrid electronic (FHE) devices. PBDT promises to deliver unprecedented selective, high-fidelity component transfer of a broad range of low-dimensional, high-performance electronic components with diverse architectures and sizes to flexible substrates. The technology will accelerate manufacturing capability to meet a critical need in the flexible and printed electronics market. The development of a stand-alone, automatic PBDT tool will provide flexible electronics developers and manufacturers an unparalleled solution for integrating high-performance thin and ultra-thin electronic materials into next-generation flexible devices. The impact on the market and on daily life has the potential to be transformative, with everything from consumer devices (e.g., flexible phones and tablets), to imaging and sensing, to health care and homeland security being improved by advancements in flexible device manufacturing. Furthermore, PBDT will enable new directions in flexible device research and product development. 

     The overall objective of the Phase II project is to produce a prototype of a commercial version of a PBDT tool. In addition, detailed performance specs of the process and tool will be established, and functional FHE devices will be assembled using automated PBDT printing. The Phase I feasibility study demonstrated that the PBDT approach of handling a flexible substrate as both a stamp and as the destination substrate allows for defect-free transfer of semiconductor components that are an order of magnitude thinner and more complex laterally than what conventional tools can handle. Based on the Phase I accomplishments, Phase II funding will be used to develop and demonstrate a prototype tool that will serve as the template for a fully automated commercial product. Successful commercialization of PBDT will require advances in PBDT processes and hardware; therefore, the specific objectives of the Phase II project are focused on (i) characterizing the full process space of PBDT technology, (ii) demonstrating a complete process flow for assembling and metalizing functional FHE devices, and (iii) validating the prototype in terms of printing rate and fidelity. The collaborating university partner will contribute to the design and fabrication of thin and ultra-thin silicon components to assess the performance of the tool and demonstrate viable FHE sensors.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from the advancement of a novel water treatment process that reduces membrane fouling and significantly lowers water treatment costs. Membrane filtration is one of the primary water treatment technologies to address the global challenge of water scarcity. However, the membrane industry suffers from low productivity and high operational cost caused by fouling. Over 95% of the water treatment plants in US that employ membrane filtration currently operate at only 30-50% of their design capacity. Our revolutionary pretreatment technology not only mitigates fouling, but also increases system productivity by up to 400% and decreases the required membrane cleaning frequency by a factor of 50, thereby saving water, money and energy. The process can reduce both the capital expense and annual operational cost of water treatment plants by roughly 25%. Our innovation is also applicable to saline water, so it can be used as a pretreatment for desalination, and it can address another major environmental challenge by removing phosphorus from wastewater and thereby reducing the prevalence of blooms of toxic algae.

    This SBIR Phase II project will continue our scale-up and commercialization activities for our pretreatment technology to improve the performance of membranes in water treatment processes with respect to contaminant removal, process productivity, and energy efficiency, compared to existing technologies. The process relies on application of a proprietary particle in a novel reactor and has been demonstrated in our Phase I work. The objectives of the Phase II work are (1) scale-up and construction of larger treatment modules using commercially suitable materials and fabrication processes; (2) testing under more aggressive operational conditions; (3) improving particle production, delivery, and disposal processes; and (4) evaluating the particles' suitability as an economic approach to remove and recover phosphorus from wastewater. The economic analysis will also be updated using data collected in Phase II study. The effort will advance the technical readiness level (TRL) of our process to TRL6, while providing essential data for further development and credibility for marketing. On completion of Phase II, we expect to be prepared for deployment in small-scale commercial systems treating one million gallons per day, and for testing in larger systems.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project comes from addressing the thermal challenges brought about by the significant increase in transistor density that semiconductors have experienced over the past few decades. This trend has enabled many advancements ranging from high performance servers to Internet of Things devices. Still, with every advance in chip technology, the difficulty of chip cooling continues to increase. Three major thermal interface material (TIM) market segments exist: polymer composites, metallic materials and phase-change materials. Commercial carbon nanotubes (CNTs) will create a fourth market segment that will supplant existing TIMs, initially in the chip testing market and eventually extending into servers, high performance computing and Internet of Things devices. CNT researchers and small businesses have made little progress towards a commercial TIM product. Among other factors, this failure is driven by poor positioning in the crowded low-cost TIM space, which is currently dominated by thermal greases and pads. Progress towards a viable solution lies in the strategic alignment of product features with industry pain points. This Phase II SBIR aims to develop a means to scale the ability to produce CNT based TIMs as well as to further improve their performance.

    The technical objectives of this SBIR Phase II project are to: 1) scale up of the CNT TIM manufacturing process to achieve a production capacity of 200,000 sq. in of product annually and to 2) enhance the conductivity of the CNT array by a factor of 3x or more to facilitate entry into the TIM1 and TIM2 market. This project will ultimately develop processes that will translate into achieving production scale CNT based thermal interface materials for the first time in the world. Scale up will be achieved through a combination of physical vapor deposition and chemical vapor deposition processes developed on tools designed specifically for CNT production. In Phase I of this research effort, two commercial products aimed at the semiconductor chip testing market were developed and validated through collaboration with leading chip manufacturers. In addition to the chip testing market segment, in Phase II products will be developed for entry into the TIM1 and Internet of Things markets.

- abstractText: "Diesel engines remain critical to global economies, but are under
    threat from increasingly-stringent emissions regulations. Many alternatives, like
    spark-ignition and electric vehicles, sacrifice some of the performance or range
    benefits of Diesel-style operation. This creates a market need for technologies
    that can maintain Diesel engine performance while remaining decoupled from the
    dirty emissions of Diesel fuel. This proposal centers on the development of the
    ?ClearFlame Combustion System? (CFCS): a novel combustion process that enables
    Diesel-style engines to combust low-carbon alternative fuels like ethanol and
    methanol without sacrificing the power possible with traditional Diesel combustion.
    Further, the sootless nature of alternative fuels such as methanol and ethanol
    obviates the need for a Diesel particulate filter, and enables stoichiometric
    air-fuel ratios to eliminate the need for selective catalytic reduction of NOx
    (smog). The engine technology has the potential to alter the dynamics of any market
    dominated by Diesel engines (including heavy-duty transportation, agriculture,
    rail, and power generation) and can be licensed to, or jointly developed with,
    OEMs for simple integration into their existing product lines. Phase I results
    have shown a 30% increase in engine torque at increased efficiency, while engine-out
    soot emissions are more than 100x lower than that of Diesel engines, falling under
    the 2010 EPA regulation limit without aftertreatment. \n\nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research Phase II project will continue development of the CFCS. The
    Phase I results showed that three critical CFCS subsystems?engine insulation,
    alcohol direct injection, and a combustion chamber optimized for stoichiometric
    combustion with exhaust gas load control?could be developed and integrated to
    achieve a previously unattainable combination of strong performance and low emissions.
    This Phase II effort will further advance these key components and demonstrate
    the benefits of the CFCS on a commercial engine platform, using CFD modeling and
    engine experiments to show the advantages of the CFCS compared to the Diesel baseline.
    The goal is to show how the CFCS enables a multi-cylinder heavy-duty engine to
    simultaneously improve power density by 30% at no loss of efficiency, while also
    achieving sootless stoichiometric exhaust conditions that are compatible with
    low-cost and highly-effective three-way catalysis (the same system that enables
    gasoline and natural gas engines to be much cleaner than Diesel). A Phase II prototype
    demonstration would realize a longtime industry goal of integrating three-way
    catalysis with a Diesel-style engine, allowing Diesel-style engines to achieve
    the emissions profile of the cleanest alternatives (like natural gas).\n\nThis
    award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of an analysis method
    and software package to identify human disease subtypes using omics data.  This
    technology will enable the ability to provide personalized treatment for patients,
    and more successful and cost-effective clinical trials, bring drugs to market
    more rapidly.  The goal is identification of disease subtypes and patient subgroups,
    a prerequisite to the ability to distinguish between patients who are in danger
    and need the most aggressive treatments, and those who are less suited to treatment
    because they will never progress or recur or they will develop resistance. Currently,
    70% of drugs entering Phase III clinical trials fail, leading to a loss of more
    than $1 trillion per year. This may be avoided by refining trial inclusion criteria
    and administering the drug only to the patients most likely to respond. The technology
    is designed to identify patient subgroups most likely to respond or not respond
    to a given treatment. This technology also may reduce the cost of prophylactic
    clinical trials by reducing the number of subjects and/or duration necessary to
    achieve sufficient power. The technology will significantly reduce drug development
    costs while simultaneously improving patient care by selecting the correct treatment
    for each patient. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project is
    to develop a novel analysis method and software package that is able to identify

    Many drug candidates fail and many patients receive inappropriate treatment because
    of the current inability to distinguish between subgroups of patients (respondents
    vs. non-respondents) and/or subtypes of disease (aggressive vs. non-aggressive).
    The current unmet challenge is to discover the molecular subtypes of disease and
    subgroups of patients. Attempts to achieve this based solely on gene expression
    signatures have been undertaken but yielded only modest success (very few gene
    expression tests are FDA-approved to date). The technology proposed here may be
    used to discover clinically relevant disease subtypes by integrating multiple
    types of high-throughput data. In addition, the Phase I results obtained on real
    patient data demonstrated that the technology is able to distinguish between more
    and less aggressive types of cancer based on their molecular profiles alone. This

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project includes reducing emission of Diesel engines' toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) in challengingly low temperature exhaust operations, while eliminating damaging urea deposits saving warranty costs for vehicle manufacturers, saving fuel, reducing greenhouse gases CO2 and N2O as well as particulate matter, while potentially enabling downsizing the complex and costly diesel emission control systems. The novel technology developed in this SBIR project may be configured for retrofitting existing diesel platforms.  Nitrogen oxides pose risks to human respiratory and pulmonary systems, are associated with forming ground level ozone, photochemical oxidants, acid rain and fine particles, amongst a variety of their detriments, and their emission is therefore regulated. Our concept, when successful, will therefore make available a broad value proposition to the society, the environment and to the mobility industry. Finally, the insights developed into its gas phase reactions may have applications in other branches of science and technology.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to resolve a currently unmet need in mitigating emission of toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) from diesel engines, especially in low exhaust temperatures such as when the vehicle operates in stop-and-go, in local delivery or when idles its engine. The goal of this project is to develop a low cost, easy-to-fit and simple-to-integrate novel technology enabling low temperature Diesel NOx reduction. Continuing our successful Phase I research results, in this Phase II project more advanced prototypes will be developed and tested in low-temperature exhaust conditions, demonstrating rapid reduction of NOx on a commercially-available Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) catalyst, while evaluating the impact on lowering greenhouse gases CO2 and N2O.  High fidelity computer simulations will be heavily utilized to further our understanding of underlying mechanisms such as the gas-phase reactions as well as to accelerate the development path. The project outcome is expected to alleviate a remaining challenge in Diesel emission control and to be rapidly welcome by the Diesel engine and vehicle industry.

    enable video-rate three-dimensional (3D) imaging within two-photon microscopes
    (2PMs) by developing novel deformable membrane mirror (DMM) technology for fast,
    precise focus control. As a subset of laser scanning microscopes (LSMs), 2PMs
    achieve very high spatial resolution by using a focused, high-power laser beam
    to excite fluorescence via the simultaneous absorption of two low-energy infrared
    photons to stimulate emission in the visible spectrum. Because of the increased
    resolution, and increased penetration of infrared light into tissue compared with
    other LSM methods, 2PMs have become widely accepted for use in the life sciences,
    specifically for neuroscience. The DMM technology developed for this project will
    address the $165 million 2PM market by delivering an electrically tunable optic
    capable of simultaneously controlling focus and aberrations while operating an
    order of magnitude faster than competitive technologies. The 3D imaging capabilities
    enabled by this technology will propel new research in the field of neuroscience
    aimed at solving widespread, chronic medical problems like stroke and Alzheimer's
    disease. Once the 2PM entry market is addressed, this technology will be refined
    to address the much larger $5.8 billion 3D laser printing market. \n\nDuring the
    Phase I project, new mirror coatings were developed to handle the high-power lasers
    used in 2PMs. With the core DMM technology in place, this Phase II project is
    aimed primarily at control of mirror actuation and shape for reliable use in 2PMs.
    The first objective of this Phase II project will develop electronics for robust
    control of mirror actuation and shape. Objective two will center on refining the
    core DMM technology and fabrication methods to enable position sensing of the
    membrane and improve mirror stroke to satisfy customers in 2PM markets. The final
    objective will involve the creation of optical and mechanical assemblies and modules
    for incorporating the DMM technology into key microscopes. The result of this
    Phase II will be a market-ready DMM product with active focus control to address
    the growing 2PM market.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has

    address the design, prototype and testing of a modular tension control device
    for individual tension regulation in the composite manufacturing sector. Composites
    are increasingly used in mission critical applications where the material and
    the product must perform reliably, while at the same time improving productivity,
    increasing product quality and lowering cost. By precisely and consistently controlling
    tension, there are fewer voids, skips or uneven tows, resulting in a higher quality
    product. This is particularly important when safety is dependent on the structural
    integrity of the materials. Overall, composite applications are greener and have
    a positive environmental impact. Comparably priced but safer automobiles from
    composites will be lighter and consume less fuel. Composites further reduce reliance
    on fossil fuels, as they are the building blocks to harness renewable energy.
    Wind blades, solar panels and underwater turbines are all made from composites.
    This is a rapidly growing multi-billion-dollar market, and the projected share
    of the targeted tension control market is in the range of $200 million, growing
    equally fast, if not faster. \n\nThis project will solve a problem that has plagued
    the composites industry since its inception. Tension control is especially difficult
    (and yet very important in the composites industry), as multiple materials with
    different tear strengths and varying elasticity are combined to make stronger
    products. Lack of cost effective tension control has, up to this point, limited
    the speed and quality of finished products. Phase II objectives are to prototype
    and develop the manufacturing process for the Modular Tensioning Cartridge. The
    Phase II Objectives are: 1) Control package design - the goal is to create a central
    base station to provide power, communications and a central interface for the
    use of multiple Modular Tensioning Cartridge units; 2) Finalization - all successfully
    tested components must be assembled into a singular industrial grade prototype
    unit and then tested; 3) Product release - upon final prototype testing, field
    trials will be conducted to validate and finalize technology leading to full production.
    In phase I, feasibility of the individual components to meet performance requirements
    was successfully demonstrated. In Phase II, prototype units will be developed
    and tested refining the design to meet the performance expectations of the customers.\n\nThis

    This SBIR Phase II project will fully develop and market a digital language tool previously found effective in helping non-native English speakers acquire language skills. It was found in SBIR Phase I that students using the tool improved their test scores both absolutely and relative to their peers. Spanish-speaking students learned more effectively when given native-language educational tools in multiple subjects. Competing educational tools are not designed to help those who are natively fluent in Spanish transfer their skills to a new language. Consequently, more than 40% of non-native speakers drop out. If successful, this project will bring to a wider market an existing educational product (created by a small, minority-owned business and already in use nationwide), and improve the educational opportunities for hundreds of thousands of non-native English-speaking students in both language arts and the scientific disciplines core to the National Science Foundation?s mission. Moreover, because schools face significant financial pressure to improve student achievement and because the product is competitively priced, it will be shown to be commercially viable, and a plan will be developed to expand the market for the tool outside of the state of California where it was initially studied.


    An expanding body of research has shown that language learners perform better on standardized tests when they can transfer their ability in another language (Spanish) to the acquisition of English. However, existing tools have not yet met this market need and focus instead on English-only instruction optimized for students who already speak natively. This project proposes to fully develop and market an existing language-acquisition platform found to be effective during pilot research in a large California school. SBIR Phase II research will address outstanding hypotheses suggested by Phase I results, and determine whether the tool can be easily adopted by stakeholders. Specifically, the impact of assignments chosen by teachers will be disambiguated from the use of the tool more generally, and the impact of English-only versus bilingual scaffolding will be studied in more detail to tailor the product to individual use cases. During Phase II, the product will also be integrated with existing academic systems and analytical software, and competitive per-seat pricing will be developed such that it can be marketed first within California and then nationwide by a network of resellers. A successful product will be measured by its effectiveness in closing the gap between native and non-native English speakers, at scale.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to facilitate understanding of cellular diversity in tumors, a phenomenon that contributes to acquired drug resistance. Quantifying and understanding this diversity may help predict a patient?s response to certain drugs which would allow the selection of ideal drug combinations for an individual patient?s tumor, thus enabling personalized medicine. This Phase II project will provide drug developers and researchers with a tool that can quantify diversity by correlating genetic and spatial information from tumors, providing crucial information about tumor composition that is currently missing today. This project will translate the technology into an efficient, high-throughput workflow that will enable commercialization with drug developers, researchers, and reference laboratories, generating both income and multiple job opportunities. The commercialization of this innovation will significantly impact scientific, corporate, and patient communities. Researchers will have a new tool improving drug development for cancer and other diseases, including Alzheimer?s and diabetes. Payers, such as insurance companies and the government, will save costs by eliminating unnecessary spending on treatments for patients who will not respond. Most importantly, patients will have broader access to personalized medicine through new treatments and screening methods that can help determine the optimum drug combinations for them.

    A single tumor contains multiple populations of cells that each have unique mutations, and it is necessary to understand the location and genetic differences of these cells in order to provide effective combination therapies that will not result in overall treatment failure or relapse. This Phase II project aims to provide drug developers, researchers, and physicians with a tool to correlate genetic and spatial information about individual tumors. Using a proprietary microfluidic device adhered to a standard microscope slide and tissue biopsy, incorporated with a laser-coupled microscope, this tool is capable of providing information that it is not possible to obtain from any other method today. Building upon the feasibility established during the Phase I project, Phase II will involve performing NGS to demonstrate the instrument?s usefulness in providing data for clinical research and biomarker discovery. It will also involve building a fully integrated prototype instrument with features that increase automation and throughput to make the technology economically feasible for commercialization. These developments will showcase the instrument?s value to customers as well as enable the commercial launch of a service.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be in promoting clean energy technologies. More than half of the United States? greenhouse gas emissions come from transportation and electricity production. Lithium-ion batteries are a promising technology to facilitate the adoption of electric vehicles and renewable power generation that drastically reduce greenhouse gas emission. However, the high cost of lithium-ion batteries threatens the commercial viability of clean technologies. This Phase II project will develop manufacturing process technologies that reduce the capital and operating costs of the most expensive step in lithium-ion battery manufacturing. Low-cost batteries will push electric vehicles towards widespread commercial adoption. Electrification of mass-transit buses will improve urban air quality, especially for the low-income population located near bus depots. Large-scale battery systems enabled by low-cost batteries will turn renewable power generation such as solar and wind from periodic energy sources into on-demand energy sources to alleviate our dependence on fossil-fuels. This Phase II project will help lithium-ion batteries become a key technology in the successful departure from oil dependence, combat of climate change, and the United States? energy security.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses the need for deeper understanding of the fundamental science behind the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. SEI layer quality is a key determinant of long-term battery reliability, performance, and safety, but the underlying electrochemistry that governs SEI composition and evolution remains poorly understood. This Phase II project will develop novel, in-situ diagnostics to directly measure the evolution, performance, and characteristics of the SEI layer as it is formed during lithium-ion battery manufacturing. Deeper insight into the complex morphology of the SEI layer will advance much-needed industry knowledge of battery performance, quality, and longevity. Additionally, there is a sizeable body of work in modeling the degradation of batteries throughout their lifecycle. With improved cell-level traceability, the manufacturing insights enabled by this Phase II project will expand the current understanding of the ?ideal battery? at the beginning of life and complement ongoing work on how batteries degrade over time. This insight opens the door for quality control in battery manufacturing based on more direct quality metrics such as longevity and reliability rather than indirect metrics such as beginning of life capacity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be the development and demonstration of a new manufacturing technology for lightweight bio-based plastics.  Plastic produced from plant materials can have lower environmental impact than petroleum-based plastics, but price and performance issues have limited their adoption. In Phase I, Grow Plastics demonstrated the ability to produce lightweight, low cost, thermally stable 100% bio-based packaging products.  In Phase II, Grow Plastics will continue the development of its products while also working to develop a full-scale manufacturing line. The goal of the technology is to replace billions of pounds of petroleum-based plastic with a lower density plastic requiring half as much material, which is made from plants.

    This SBIR Phase II research project proposes to continue the development of a new manufacturing process for layered structures in biomaterials.  Grow Plastics has demonstrated the ability to generate novel, high-performance layered cellular structures in biopolymers in a new manufacturing process using new machinery.  The challenge in Phase II will be to continue the development in materials from Phase I while also scaling the technology to industrial scale.  Materials science and manufacturing techniques will include polymer blending, solid state foaming, and thermal crystallization of polymer blends. Analysis techniques will include tensile testing, differential scanning calorimetry, thermo mechanical analysis, and evaluation of final product properties.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a sustainable, low-cost, and replicable
    method for large-scale production of micro-algal biomass. Microalgae production
    is a form of aquaculture capable of producing valuable products including:  Nutraceuticals,
    specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals, feed for finfish, shellfish, and livestock,
    as well as food for human consumption.  Moreover, microalgae can be used as a
    feedstock for biofuels while simultaneously removing CO2 from the environment.
    \  However, for the nascent algae cultivation industry to achieve its full commercial
    potential, the technology must be improved.  While typical algal cultivation relies
    on high-density cell growth, this project will focus on the science of low-density
    algal cultivation to achieve high productivity, while minimizing process requirements
    for supplemental energy and concentrated CO2.  In addition, the development of
    a closed-system photo-bioreactor with emphasis on low cost and modular design
    will allow the process to be easily replicated on a variety of lands with otherwise
    marginal value. As such, the system can become the basis for a robust aquaculture
    and biofuels industry, leading to greater economic development in marginal communities
    and a source of sustainable products for the growing world population. \n\nThis
    SBIR Phase II project proposes to further optimize the design of the large-scale
    algal production system developed during the Phase I project to address key challenges
    in algae cultivation including frequent contamination, low productivity, and increased
    operating costs due to inefficient use of water and energy. Research activities
    will focus on four main objectives: 1) Finalize key design specifications for
    reactor geometry, materials of construction, and system components in order to
    maximize productivity and minimize capital costs; 2) optimize harvest apparatus
    design and biomass concentration procedure to further reduce water consumption;
    3) develop a new media formulation to allow for stable pH control without the
    need for concentrated CO2; and 4) refine manufacturing of the reactor bladder
    to ensure sterility, durability, and product consistency.  In addition to the
    basic algae cultivation techniques employed in Phase I, Phase II will make greater
    use of engineering /computational analyses to arrive at optimal designs.  The
    target outcome of the project is a 120,000-L closed photo-bioreactor capable of
    sustaining H. pluvialis algae production rates of greater than 9 g/m2/d for a
    minimum of 4 months without detrimental contamination.  In addition, the system
    will provide significant reductions in consumption of energy, water, and concentrated
    CO2."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to de-risk the volume manufacturability and reliability of thin crystalline power MOSFETs fabricated with a novel exfoliation technology demonstrated in Phase 1.  The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable lower cost and better performance for power devices in switching or transferring electricity under varying power requirements across the voltage spectrum in a variety of applications ranging from consumer, to communications, automotive and industrial applications.  In all of these applications, the ON resistance of the power MOSFET and IGBTs can be reduced and the switching speed and performance further improved by reducing the device thickness.  Additionally, in consumer and mobile applications, reducing the form factor of the power MOSFET devices can enable slimmer and lighter products.  A significant broader impact of this technology will be the reduction of expensive and environmentally hazardous waste treatment processes associated with wafer grinding technology used in the power MOSFET industry.  While the power MOSFETs developed using this technology can have broad commercial and societal impact, the use of this thin crystalline technology can have even broader impact across all modern semiconductor devices such as LED, PV, flexible CMOS and passive devices.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses challenges to further scaling of Power MOSFETs which are one of the key building blocks of the electronic revolution over the last few decades. While the feature size of transistors has been constantly shrinking, the substrate thickness has been increasing. These substrates are currently mechanically thinned to minimize the negative impact of this increased thickness on performance and form-factor. There are significant challenges to continue this trend and the thin crystalline technology and device architecture proposed here can enable continued scaling of device metrics over the next decade with favorable cost structures.  During phase I, functional power MOSFETs were demonstrated with this thin crystalline technology to establish the feasibility of this technology for power devices. This phase II effort will focus on the following specific technical challenges to bring it to market. (1) Develop power MOSFETs with improved switching characteristics using the thin crystalline technology (2) High voltage high current characterization of the thin crystalline power MOSFETs (3) Process yield and reliability characterization of package thin crystalline power MOSFET parts and (4) Convert existing process line to use thin crystalline exfoliation technology in high volume manufacturing flow.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project aims to develop a sensor with the ability to provide an accurate, small, cost-effective, and low-power device for the detection and quantification of natural gas. The current U.S. industrial natural gas leak detector market is estimated to be $325 million, while the residential natural gas detector market exceeds $2 billion, both of which indicate the strong market potential of this technology. Phage-based colorimetric sensing is a new sensing mechanism, and has the potential to replace and improve detection across many applications. This project, if successful, will have a number of broader impacts.  Firstly, 670 billion cubic feet (cf) of methane is leaked annually in the U.S. natural gas industry. Better monitoring and recapturing of the lost gas will result in less reliance on imported gas (3 trillion cf in 2015), thus stimulating economic growth and reducing waste.  Additionally, a new type of sensor that provides accurate, compact, inexpensive, and power-efficient natural gas monitoring with wireless communication capabilities will enable large scale natural gas emission monitoring studies, providing a tool for scientists and regulators.  Finally, a reduction of methane emissions will help combat climate change, as methane is a powerful greenhouse gas.

    During the Phase I project, we have successfully fabricated colorimetric thin-film sensors, developed a data analysis algorithm, and shown our sensors are both consistent and selective against individual components of natural gas at industrially-suitable sensitivity. In Phase II, we will further improve the production and performance of the phage sensors. There are six objectives in this Phase II project. The first is to do sensor calibration using precise gas calibration instrumentation to improve sensor accuracy. Secondly, the sensors will undergo environmental stress testing to evaluate longevity. Third, a scale-up feasibility study will be undertaken to determine and optimize sensor cost. The fourth task involves the development of improved and more inexpensive sensor designs, while the fifth task will optimize the production process of the new sensor. The sixth objective involves a more comprehensive characterization of the sensor.  It is anticipated that by the end of Phase II, we will have a precisely- calibrated gas sensor with data recognition algorithms, and an established and scalable manufacturing model, resulting in an improved colorimetric sensor development kit for natural gas that better meets customer needs in the field.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project includes tremendous commercial potential, societal benefits, and scientific advances. Conventional superabsorbent polymers (SAP) are based on polyacrylates or polyacrylamides derived from petroleum feedstock. They are widely used in the absorbent cores of hygiene products, with disposable diapers representing approximately 85% of the global SAP market of $6B. Increasing consumer and supply chain demand for more natural, sustainable materials and products has driven the development of eco-friendly / natural labeled absorbent hygiene products (AHP). Eco-friendly diaper products currently make up about 3% of the global market and are experiencing strong growth at 10-15% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). This project will lead to the commercialization of a low-cost high-performance biobased SAP, offering significant environmental benefits as a more sustainable, eco-friendly alternative to petrobased SAP. This project could also generate positive economic impacts on domestic agriculture by creating new demand for bio-feedstocks such as waste glycerol. Finally, this project advances the scientific and technological state-of-the-art by developing a new bioprocess based on microbial co-cultures that could be extended to render more efficient, cost-effective routes for producing other biobased fuels and chemicals.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to develop a new biological route, based on microbial co-cultures, for cost-effective production of gamma-polyglutamic acid (PGA) and to commercialize cross-linked PGA SAP for AHP applications. In Phase I of this project, a microbial co-culture process was developed for efficient production of PGA via in-situ precursor production (ISPP) from low-cost bio-feedstocks. materials. Building on promising results in Phase I, further R&D will aim to reach pilot-scale production by the end of Phase II. Three specific technical objectives will be pursued: Objective 1: Strain engineering and bioprocess optimization to develop an ISPP fermentation process with commercially viable performance metrics. Objective 2: Optimization of downstream purification, SAP cross-linking, and finishing to produce a high performance finished PGA SAP product. Objective 3: Pilot-scale process demonstration to produce commercial quantities of PGA SAP for large scale customer/partner trials. This R&D plan will lead to transformative technological outcomes. The proposed process based on microbial co-cultures represents a distinct shift from the conventional paradigm of utilizing single-species monocultures for bioprocessing and offers substantial cost-savings. The engineering and process development strategies developed during this project will be transferrable for a broad range of other co-culture bioprocessing applications.

    This Phase II project aims to help address the achievement gap for English Learners, who consistently average 21% below native English speakers on reading scale scores starting in 4th grade and are twice as likely to drop out of school. Eighty percent of teachers believe that materials for English Learners are sub-standard, which contributes to this gap. The project provides an online crowd-authoring and sharing platform that gives K-6 language teachers the tools to meet their unique instructional needs on demand. It is the first and only platform to enable practicing teachers to rapidly build digital language lessons and interactive games that align to their specific requirements, without any technical know-how. The platform provides built-in rich media resources that adhere to best practices based on the cognitive theory of multimedia learning. Any teacher may access these open educational resources at no cost, provided they make their own creations available for public reuse, revision and remixing. The project seeks to understand the dynamics of collaboration and quality assurance for interactive content at a massive scale. Crowd-authoring can invest educators with the power to transform language learning into a field that is highly responsive to the evolving needs of educators and learners.

    This Phase II project will pioneer mass customization of interactive games and media in the field of second language acquisition. The project aims for teachers to create 175,000 custom digital lessons and interactive games using media resources provided by the project. Phase II will develop four new types of games that improve language acquisition using audiovisual experimentation, realtime chat with artificial intelligences, and a new technology that transforms visuals and narratives composed by students into grammatically accurate text and audio. Phase II will integrate these innovations into a crowd-authoring and quality assurance system capable of scaling to 100,000 new teacher-made learning objects per month. By giving language educators tools to rapidly create, share and customize content to meet their precise needs, the project seeks to significantly improve learning outcomes. Phase II will implement real-time formative assessment reports for teachers to evaluate student experiences and issues with the custom teacher-made interactive content. A controlled full-year, multi-site educational impact study will measure whether the project affects vocabulary acquisition, comprehension, grammar and sentence formation, and whether any skill gains transfer to other contexts. It will also reveal deep data insights about the process by which K-6 students acquire a second language.

    This Phase II project proposes to develop a computer science (CS) educational software that has the potential to inspire millions of U.S. K-12 students to learn computer programming.  This software will leverage the motivational power of a popular video game, to teach CS to students by teaching them to reprogram the video game itself.  The United States currently has a severe deficit of students pursuing CS.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that over 1 million computing job openings will go unfilled by U.S. workers by 2022.  By leveraging the power of a popular video game, the technology proposed in this Phase II project has the potential to expose millions of K-12 students to coding in the next 5 years.  The commercial impact of the underlying technology developed in this Phase II project does not stop at the over 100 million users who currently play the popular video game with which the current educational software integrates.  Because the underlying technology is transferable to any moddable (i.e. reprogrammable) video game, the technology has the potential to be used to teach CS with other popular titles from the rapidly growing video game industry.

    This Phase II project proposes to continue the development of a software product that is a web-based coding environment for novice programmers.  This software goes beyond the state-of-the-art technologies in this space (i.e., scratch.mit.edu) in several ways: 1) It uses automated tutoring techniques to customize the educational experiences for novices, 2) it facilitates writing programs that manipulate objects and terrain in a 3D environment, 3) it allows the novice user to reprogram a popular video game, 4) it has an in-browser, WebGL-based 3D runtime environment, 5) it supports both a novice-friendly visual programming language (Blockly) as well as a text-based language (JavaScript), 6) it leverages gamification techniques such as badges, points, and unlockable items, and 7) it supports multi-user, collaborative coding.  The objectives of this Phase II project concentrate on improving student experiences in order to increase customer retention and acquisition and to finish the development of a marketable product that will teach 5 million K-12 students in the next 5 years.  The first objective of this project involves developing and extending the browser-embedded game engine.  The second objective focuses on improving systems that match students with appropriate educational content and motivate students to continue learning.  Finally, the third objective involves implementing new systems that incentivize students to create and share with the community.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve our ability to fight infectious diseases that negatively impact agricultural yields and reduce the efficiency of global food production and distribution systems. This innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding by leveraging the power of high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics to provide a pathogen identification and surveillance tool with demonstrated efficacy against known and unknown infectious agents. This platform is fast, sensitive, and cost-effective, and can be used for any animal sample to detect virtually all possible microbes even microbes that have never before been characterized. Hundreds of samples can be rapidly screened without relying upon known genetic/genomic data of microbes. The global molecular diagnostics market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 14% from 2012 to 2017, with infectious disease testing being the leading application at 26% share, therefore the commercial opportunity of this project is vast.

    The proposed project follows up on the validation of the diagnostic platform (SBIR Phase I) and delves deeper into improving virus detection and genetic data generation. In addition, this proposal seeks to develop a basal informatics infrastructure that together with sample preparation improvements will be conducive of scalable, high-throughput analysis of several samples. Current diagnostic methods rely on what is already known about target microbe genetics, and provide limited information in the form of presence/absence of a known target sequence. The SBIR Phase I was instrumental to lowering the technical risks associated with a high-throughput unbiased pathogen detection platform based on DNA sequencing and Bayesian statistics. In the pursue of standardizing and validating our metagenomics pathogen identification platform, this project proposes to: 1) improve viral detection capabilities and accuracy, 2) develop new functionalities, and 3) incorporate Phase I and Phase II advances into an integrated in-house web-accessible interface.

    developed a high-performance software code to rapidly design novel metabolic pathways
    to produce any target chemical from central metabolism. In Phase II, the company
    will further advance the concept by (1) developing a high-performance pathway
    prioritization module to estimate each designed pathway yield and impact on organism
    metabolism in the context of whole-genome models and (2) use the software platform
    to design libraries of pathways for the production of a variety of specialty chemical
    targets that are commercially valuable and not known to be produced by fermentation
    at scale. Then, (3) using an experimental screening setup, the DNA for all the
    proposed pathways will be assembled screened at high-throughput for detectable
    production of the target chemicals."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the potential to directly and positively impact the speed of chemical analysis leading to cleaner and more advanced products. Technology resulting from the proposed activity will solve several pain points in the chemical analysis industry, including non-linearity, small dynamic range and variable, sometimes negligible, detector response. As a result, the technology will have broad use and lead to improved detection in pharmaceuticals, drug development, fuels, chemicals, renewables, foods, flavors, and academic and industrial research. Uniform response to carbon from flame ionization detection (FID) would be completely disruptive to the painstaking methods of calibration of known compounds and the guesswork associated with the quantification of unknowns. The benefits of this technology are expected to result in immense improvements in the speed and accuracy of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, thereby leading to better and safer products, with faster development times. Applied to the pharmaceutical and new drug development industry, this technology will have lasting impacts on the health and safety of society due to better and faster analyses available.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to deliver a carbon selective detector (CSD) to the global scientific market.  The CSD is a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)  detector that produces a linear response to all organic compounds using a flame ionization detection (FID)  and a catalytic reactor. The key innovation is the novel development and use of a catalytic reactor to transform organic molecules and remove solvent in liquid chromatograph effluent streams. The FID, similar to those ubiquitous in gas chromatography (GC) systems, yields a universal response to organic compounds converted to methane with unparalleled linear range and robustness. The device will overcome limitations of the FID that have prevented previous use in HPLC by selectively removing solvents, oxidizing organic compounds to carbon dioxide, reducing carbon dioxide to methane, and detecting the resulting methane with the FID.  The resulting product features, most notably a universal response to carbon, will provide pre-clinical pharmaceutical researchers with a tool that can quantify drugs and their by-products during screening, long before the process has been scaled up for the production of calibration standards.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a fast, efficient, and scalable cell engineering technology that is easily automated through integration with liquid handling robots.  Currently, there is a bottleneck in the process of cell engineering, especially in the engineering of cells for discovery of new therapeutics.  The field of delivery of genetic or other material to cells has not kept pace with advancements in genetic modification and high-throughput screening technologies.  The proposed platform will offer an alternative to the time-consuming and labor-intensive methods of transfection including lentiviral transduction and cuvette-based electroporation, which are difficult to automate.  Applications of cell engineering technology range from fundamental research in cell physiology to the discovery of new targets for cellular therapies.  The platform will allow scientists and clinicians to more rapidly and reliably engineer immune and other cells for discovery of new therapeutic targets and therapeutics.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project will be to develop a scalable, automated, non-viral cell engineering platform with the potential to operate up to 10,000 times faster than conventional electroporation using high-throughput liquid handling.  Using the core cell engineering technology developed in Phase I, the goal is to develop an automated protocol for gene transfection on a liquid handling robot compatible with 96 or 384 well plate technology.  The first objective is to demonstrate the manufacturability of cell engineering devices for high-throughput cell engineering. Preliminary work in this area has shown that these devices can be injection molded, thus reducing cost while increasing the potential for production at scale. In the Phase II project, injection molded prototypes of the cell engineering devices will be developed to prove manufacturability and determine the cost to manufacture at scale (millions of parts per year). Second, there are several supplemental systems that must be integrated with a liquid handling apparatus to enable the proposed high-throughput cell engineering. Supplemental systems include a power source and power distribution manifold that interacts with each sample of the 96 or 384 well array. In this project, these systems will be integrated with the cell engineering devices and automated liquid handling robot. Third, the integrated system will be used to generate a large library of primary human T cell variants as proof-of-concept to demonstrate the potential for high-throughput cell engineering for therapeutic target discovery.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from the fact that it builds on the trend to make IT infrastructure consumable as a service and unlocks this potential for network functions. In deploying the Stateless Network Functions as a Service solution, cloud providers, enterprises, and internet service providers are able to launch network functions, such as firewalls and load balancers, on demand, and the Stateless platform automates the management of these functions.  With cloud traffic expected to quadruple over the next several years (according to Cisco), a rapid growth in number of devices (with the Internet of Things emerging), and an ever-increasing complexity and scale of security threats, this project will provide operators with the agility to quickly and easily deploy infrastructure to keep up with these trends and threats.  In doing so, society will experience more reliable networked applications with reduced data breaches.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project provides the research and development needed to realize the vision of a network function operating system.  Whereas the Phase I project established technical feasibility by demonstrating the technology that decouples network functions state from processing can be turned into a product and integrated into a production environment, the Phase II project will approach three new research directions that will support a complete platform.  (i) Network service chaining:  While not a new concept, it is one that has proven to be challenging with virtual appliances.  This project will add support to the Stateless platform to connect network functions into chains, elastically scale chains, and provide quality of service of the whole chain.  (ii) Observability:  This project will introduce the ability to abstract away the details when appropriate or peel away the layers of abstraction as needed, providing operators with a simple solution they have full control over.  (iii) Software development kit:  This project will introduce both the application programming interfaces as well as the isolation mechanisms to allow third parties, whether other vendors or data center operators, to introduce new network functionality based on the Stateless platform.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project involves addressing complexities in fluid management, one of the most important issues in critical care. Suboptimal fluid management results in many complications such as pulmonary edema. Studies show that fluid overload is associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Recent studies also show that restrictive fluid resuscitation protocols result in a reduction of mechanical ventilation days and hospital length of stay. The clinical literature provides ample evidence of optimized fluid therapy benefits for different patient populations including those with sepsis and post-operative patients. However, implementation of fluid therapy is highly subjective. Specifically, the most critical unanswered questions involve the timing and the volume of fluid infusions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to develop a system which uses continuous measurements from a standard intensive care unit hemodynamic monitoring device to provide actionable feedback for clinicians to optimize fluid and vasoactive drug management. In the proposed Phase II work, we will further develop the clinical decision support system developed in Phase I. This includes further development of the underlying technology and also performing preliminary clinical studies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable mobile robots to coexist harmoniously with people in their homes and offices. The market for consumer and office robots is projected to grow 17% annually, seven times faster than the market for manufacturing robots, reaching $1.5B by 2019. An important step toward market growth is creating autonomous robots that are unobtrusive, intelligent, and highly agile. Accomplishing this requires robots to be small enough to stay out of the way and fast enough to elegantly avoid humans and environmental obstacles. Inappropriate noise levels and safety concerns make it unlikely that airborne vehicles will be prevalent in indoor environments, whereas wheeled mobile robots can achieve near-silent operation. Tiny, fast robots are unobtrusive enough to use as a low-cost surveillance tool in home or office security, and portable enough for covertly investigating hostile situations. People with severe disabilities could travel vicariously by combining a virtual reality headset with a telepresence robot.
    Fast maneuvering robots could be used as a compelling educational or entertainment platform for kids and adults.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will integrate the Phase I feasibility work on multi-surface aggressive maneuvering for small robots into a consumer-affordable hardware platform suitable for commercialization. In addition to developing a miniaturized robotic platform, this project will also address challenges outside the scope of Phase I related to home-scale autonomous navigation to locations of interest, which can be fixed (such as a room) or dynamic (such as the location of a pet). Such challenges
    include multi-room mapping, planning, path execution, and high-speed obstacle avoidance. This project will also develop fail-safe reactive techniques for navigation in situations where a model of the environment is either incorrect or altogether unavailable. Four key Phase II objectives will address these challenges: 1) multi-room surface-aware maneuvering with vision-based localization, 2) efficient maneuvering in the presence of obstacles and clutter, 3) map initialization for monitoring places of interest, and 4) development of the final hardware platform.

    This SBIR Phase I project will produce an innovative reading application and administrative portal to support science learning. Although the science textbook is a central curricular resource, this resource is often inaccessible and difficult to read. Science textbooks are syntactically (grammatically) and semantically (word meaning) complex. Specifically, elementary and secondary science texts are often written 3 to 5 years beyond what is developmentally appropriate. Because of these complexities, science textbooks often overwhelm students' working memory, preventing them from constructing accurate mental representations of the target concepts. Thus, this project will develop and test a multiplatform, personalizable e-reader with embedded reading and language support. The intellectual merit of the effort resides in its ability to improve science comprehension through personalized and adaptive content. This project will produce content and assessments targeting the Next Generation Science Standards associated with Earth and Space Science. The customizable features will make fundamental science knowledge more accessible and interesting to students -- and thus the Public. Given these benefits, it has strong potential to support future generations of STEM professionals and a more scientifically literate citizenry.


    This project will produce a multiplatform reading application to support science learning. The key innovation will be to make science content adaptable and adjustable for learners. This Phase II project has five technical goals: (a) develop and test the e-reader to work via tablet and mobile web; (b) develop and test enhanced reading features; (c) develop and test administrative and payment portals; (d) develop and curate NGSS-aligned content and assessments; (e) conduct user testing with students and teachers. During Phase II, the project team will address some technological challenges in bringing this innovation to market. The key features of the interactive reading application create a potential for unnecessary memory load. This technological challenge will be overcome by architecting the program to be highly preprocessed and modular. A second challenge is providing secure access to multi-tiered users. This technical challenge will be overcome by architecting the program to allow for secure, multiple group membership, ensuring data visibility and security. A diverse SquidBooks team, with expertise in business, software design and engineering, educational research and measurement, science education, writing, and science will achieve these goals of this Phase II project.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be in helping batteries exceed the quality, performance, and safety demands of mass-market electric vehicles, renewable energy generation, and next-generation consumer electronic devices. The need for high-performance batteries is accelerating, and as batteries grow in energy density, size, and production volumes, so will the issues that persist with quality. Unless these issues are addressed, they will continue to have major implications for the performance, safety, and adoption of these important technologies. The challenge is that outside of R&D labs, the industry relies on essentially the same basic data as when batteries were first invented: voltage, current, and temperature. As a result, at commercial scales, only a small percentage of batteries are inspected in a meaningful way, with methods that only provide indirect information about physical condition. This Phase 2 project is focused on developing a new platform for production-level battery inspection that directly probes the physical condition of batteries with a high testing throughput. This could lead to better decisions in manufacturing environments and could decrease system costs, increase capacity and operational lifetime, and accelerate the scale-up of promising new materials.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses the need for a physical mode of inspection in battery production environments that is capable of screening every cell with high fidelity. Currently, inspection in production-level environments are limited to electrical measurements and X-rays. Electrical methods provide only indirect and cell-averaged information about physical condition, and X-rays are not practically able to detect the distribution of electrolyte within batteries nor the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer (both of which strongly affect long-term reliability, performance, and safety of batteries). This Phase 2 project aims to develop a platform that utilizes sound-based methods to inspect batteries in production-environments. This will involve developing a scaled, automated hardware system as well as software and computational methods for processing and analyzing the acoustic signals. The Phase 2 project will also include various testing and validation efforts to assess the ability of acoustic analysis to both directly determine the performance quality and reliability of cells beyond beginning of life capacity and resistance, as well as to improve the performance of strings of cells and modules.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is provided by a novel data processing architecture, utilizing high-parallel in-memory computing for certain recurring and data intensive functions. Traditional computer architecture funnels all data through the central processing unit (CPU). Multiple CPU cores and very high clock frequencies are used to address the issue of ever increasing demands on data processing capability. However, the transportation capacity of data between memory and CPU cores has become a limiting factor creating a 'memory bottleneck'. This limitation is most noticeable in the recent and rapid development of artificial intelligence applications which deploy so called neuromorphic computing techniques, which in turn require a very high parallelism in computation and proportional demands on memory bandwidth. This project performs key repetitive operations within the memory itself, leveraging the inherent parallelism of the memory architecture, thereby avoiding a large percentage of the data transport otherwise required. The resulting elimination of the memory bottleneck provides a path forward for high complexity neuromorphic computing applications such as autonomous navigation used for self-driving cars. Reduced demands on data transport and CPU also significantly reduce power consumption, enabling a wide variety of mobile artificial intelligence applications.

    The proposed project investigates the system level integration challenges of a memory-centric neuromorphic computing approach, and aims to demonstrate a seamless integration with existing software platforms currently using traditional neuromorphic computing processors. It is important for a novel hardware platform to be compatible with existing software in order to lower barriers to market entry. This Phase II project also develops the actual semiconductor product which has been investigated in Phase I as a feasibility demonstrator. The Phase II product is based on a non-volatile high density memory architecture, and as such is expected to provide the full capability in terms of both power and operations per second. Once the hardware is available in the second half of the project, these key parameters will be thoroughly characterized and benchmarked against the current state of the art technology. A projection will be made outlining the future scaling potential using ultra high density volatile and non-volatile memory geared towards high complexity neuromorphic computing beyond what is currently possible using existing approaches.

    This SBIR Phase II project seeks to develop a novel low-cost molecular filter for use in harsh environments. This is accomplished using commodity silica gel, commonly found as a desiccant in food packing, whose pores can be made to be only a few molecules wide. Accurate tuning of the size and shape of the silica gel pores enables certain molecules to pass through while others are blocked from passing. One promising application for these molecular filters is their use in grid-scale energy storage. Flow batteries could store city-sized quantities of renewable energy. However, they require the use of expensive molecular filters that are not easily replaced due to the harsh battery environments. The low-cost filters developed during this SBIR Phase II project have the potential to reduce the cost of flow batteries by as much as 15%, making them less expensive than grid-scale lithium ion batteries. Lower cost grid-scale storage means that more renewable energy generation (e.g., solar & wind) can be added without overwhelming the grid. Low cost molecular filter also has commercial upside with the potential to capture a significant fraction of the $2.7 billion-dollar market. Because of this, this project could generate nearly 15 jobs and $39 million dollars in tax revenue over the next 5 years.


    This SBIR Phase II Project is developing a molecularly selective sol-gel ceramic membrane that does not require calcination or high polymer loading but also does not fracture during compression in stack applications (e.g., fuel cells and flow batteries). This is accomplished by decoupling the selective region from the region of the membrane being compressed by the stack. These membranes will be utilized to improve the performance and reduce the costs of all-vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB). VRFB membranes require selective transport of hydronium ions but not vanadium ions. Size and charge exclusion membranes must therefore have tight control over the pore size, shape and network structure to selectively transport ions. Towards this end, sol-gel processing and surface charge modification will be utilized to maximize proton conductivity and limit vanadium ion permeability. Optimized membrane formulations must also have excellent chemical and mechanical stability; showing no degradation after hundreds of VRFB cycles. Finally, membranes must be scaled from lab size (50 cm2) to commercial size (> 500cm2) while maintaining performance uniformity. The low-cost membranes developed during this SBIR Phase I project have the potential to reduce the cost of VRFBs by as much as 15%. Lower cost grid-scale storage means that more renewable energy generation (e.g., solar & wind) can be added without overwhelming the grid.

    This SBIR Phase II project will expand on Phase I R&D work to build, test, and optimize a web-based software system for the classroom setting to complement the digital library app for home use developed in Phase I. This cost-effective system will further promote adult-mediated dialogic reading routines with children 0-7 years in age. Early exposure to dialogic reading has been shown to foster virtually all school and reading-readiness indicators - from cognitive and social-emotional development to vocabulary attainment and concepts about print. The new system also introduces foundational science knowledge and habits, such as the capacity to observe, experiment, and problem solve. The ever-widening education attainment and opportunity gaps between rich and poor result in diminished human potential and citizens unequipped for the demands of an information-based labor market. Investments in early childhood can prevent educational deficits, so a cost-effective system that coaches adults to engage children in a dialogic reading process can make a substantial contribution to ending school-readiness gaps - the precursor to persistent achievement gaps - and the cycle of economic and societal disadvantages they perpetuate. This project also addresses the urgent need to bolster the teaching of higher-order thinking skills by early education teachers. The market for early-education digital products is sizable and growing. Purchasers in this market are K-3 schools, preschools, Head Start, social- service agencies, and libraries, as well as individual families.


    This project will build the technical capacity to augment and measure the growth of adult-led dialogic reading with children 0-7 years in age. The systems architecture and proprietary algorithms will produce a system that increases adult capacity for dialogic questioning and exploration by using the copyrighted, text-specific guidance embedded in the library. Metrics, children's work product, and online adult-learning modules aim to incentivize and build teacher/caregiver confidence, inform school leaders, and focus them on continued application of the dialogic process to other books and subjects. Augmentations to the content management system developed in Phase I will enable the sales, distribution, management, and evaluation of all product form factors. The secure data-sharing portal and dashboard built through this project will allow institutional clients to monitor and evaluate their programs. R&D will include collection of engagement metrics, including usage data (access to which is built into the digital library) and online surveys. The core innovation to be studied is whether this product enables adults of varying educational backgrounds to practice an intellectually ambitious reading and thinking method with their children.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will pilot field test controlled release polymers (CRPs) as an in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) remediation material. With a controlled time release of the oxidant payload, the CRPs technology treats contaminated water over longer periods eliminating the occurrence of contaminant rebound resulting in overall shorter cleanup time and total cost. ISCO is the fastest growing field among sub surface contaminant remediation technologies. Current commercial ISCO deployment methods utilize liquid oxidants as reagents which possess short term reactivity (days). To address contaminant rebounding, these injectable formulations require costly re-injections. This project would result in a novel product that is environmentally  benign  and  achieves sustained release  of  oxidative  agents  over extended  treatment  periods  (months  to years)  with  a  single application. CRPs are a novel technology, offering a highly tunable remediation amendment for the $1.4B Chemical Treatment Remediation Market. Ultimately, CRPs based treatments will decrease exposure to groundwater contaminants known to cause many human health disorders.

    The technical objectives in this Phase II research project will be to field test CRPs patented, controlled release polymer technology for in situ chemical oxidation of contaminated groundwater.  To support field testing, a pilot scale manufacturing process for the initial minimum viable product established in Phase I will be developed. Manufacturability will be tested in terms of product quality and stability, throughput, and cost. CRPs formulations based on multiple oxidants, will be manufactured to address a broad range of environmental contaminants including chlorinated solvents, BTEX (benzene/toluene/ethylbenzene/xylene), PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether), and petroleum hydrocarbons. CRPs will be pilot tested at two field sites with impacted soil and groundwater. The rate and duration of oxidant delivery and contaminant degradation will be measured. In particular, pilot field testing will assess the ability of CRPs to eliminate rebounding. Field data and computation modeling will be used to create a remediation design tool to prescribe future CRP dosing deployment strategies. Collectively, this Phase II program will result in a clear understanding of in-field performance of the CRPs technology to guide future full scale deployment and market uptake.

    This SBIR Phase II project seeks to develop an internet-of-things (IoT) data collection and analysis platform for collaborative STEM and big data research and education, that enables collaborative, geographically dispersed collection of data from internet enabled scientific instruments. STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) jobs are on the rise: the U.S. Department of Commerce predicts that occupations in these sectors will grow by 8.9 % from 2014 to 2024. Yet the U.S. currently faces a critical shortage of workers and students who are proficient in math and science subjects. In part, this shortage is due to a lack of interest in STEM-related fields by minorities and women. Engaging, relevant and hands on experiences are needed to encourage interest amongst these populations. This project fulfills the requests of the federal government and leading-edge STEM educators that both secondary and post-secondary institutions teach science in a way that engages students with real-world problems. The expectation is that this project will make big data accessible, while providing rewarding and appealing hands-on learning opportunities that will increase data literacy; increase scientific collaboration in education across geographic and interdisciplinary lines; and increase scientific literacy and interest across demographics, thus increasing the likelihood that students will continue to pursue scientific careers.

    The proposed technology will be the first collaborative educational IoT STEM platform to be developed, and is innovative in the field of Educational Technology, which has yet to adopt web-connected sensors that generate big data on a global scale. At present, there is no mechanism for schools to collect and share real data between classrooms and schools in an organized way. The proposed innovation allows users to communicate via a global network and is capable of being paired with an unlimited variety of scientific instruments and data sources, to support versatile, engaging, coordinated, multi-school experiments and data sharing. Data science now impacts virtually every profession in some way, and the platform will uniquely expose students to big data analytics in an engaging and relevant way. In Phase 1, feasibility of approach was firmly established. Phase II objectives will be to expand the educational platform developed in Phase I to optimize national/global impact and support applicability to big data research as well as a range of sensors. Goals include to expand tools to view and analyze data, refine and expand curriculum, develop an Application Programming Interface and create software tools to manipulate and share data/curriculum. The platform's ability to promote greater learning will also be evaluated.

    This SBIR Phase II project will address the lack of high application temperature materials available for additive manufacturing. Additive manufacturing, often called 3D printing, provides increased design freedom and complex features such as part consolidation and conformal cooling channels. The performance and efficiency of gas turbines and other applications can be increased by combining design improvements enabled by additive manufacturing with a suitable high temperature material. Unfortunately, existing materials either do not have sufficient high temperature performance or are not compatible with high quality printing methods. This project will develop new nickel superalloy composite additive manufacturing materials for use with high temperature gas turbine components. Successful completion of this project will result in more efficient turbines to reduce energy costs, transportation costs, and carbon emissions. The manufacturing, power generation, and aerospace industries are expected to be impacted from this project. In addition, history has demonstrated that new materials and manufacturing technologies often lead to additional unexpected innovations. This project will help the country lead in the innovation of high performance materials technology to address the needs of the $86 billion gas turbine market and to grow advanced manufacturing jobs in the US.



    This project will utilize innovative reactive additive manufacturing materials technology to develop 3D printable advanced high temperature superalloys. During additive fabrication, high melting temperature product phases will be synthesized in-situ within a superalloy matrix to significantly improve high temperature performance and improve printability. This innovative reactive additive manufacturing technology has been shown to be applicable to a wide range of materials systems including nickel superalloys in an NSF Phase I project. Metal matrix composites produced using this technology have demonstrated greatly increased strength, wear resistance, and high temperature performance relative to comparable traditional alloys. In addition, this technology has demonstrated the ability to eliminate micro and macro cracking problems with alloys that had previously been considered unprintable. This project aims to further develop one or more high temperature superalloys compatible with laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing for use in the hot sections of gas turbines. The scope of the project includes theoretical and experimental development and evaluation of novel material feedstocks, additive manufacturing processing conditions, and heat treatments. Evaluation of printed components will include measurement of density, hardness, standard and high temperature tensile properties, creep, and microstructure and phase analysis. Turbine components will be additively fabricated for pilot studies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to provide an affordable sealant for sealing joints and cracks in cement concrete pavement, asphalt concrete pavement, bridge deck, etc. In transportation infrastructure, joints are intentionally constructed in order to allow movement of the structural elements due to linear thermal expansion/contraction when temperature rises/drops. Cracks are a common failure mode in pavement, and if not properly sealed, can cause water damage and rupture of the concrete. Sealing cracks and joints is a common practice to maintain or extend the service life of structural elements. Various types of sealants are currently used with an annual market value of about $6.1 billion. Unfortunately, many of these sealants fail to work properly and are ineffective in extending service life. In this project, a smart sealant will be developed that expands upon cooling and contracts upon heating, a thermal characteristic opposite to that of concrete. The product will address a significant problem in the industry arising from thermal movement of joined/cracked structural elements. It is expected that the product will have about 0.8% market share in 5 years helping with the need for longer lasting and more reliable infrastructure.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in the development and validation of a smart sealant technology. The root cause for joint failure is that the thermal expansion characteristics of most sealants is similar to that of concrete, i.e., contraction upon cooling and expansion upon heating. This behavior is contrary to what is required of sealants in order to avoid thermally induced separation between the sealant and the concrete. Unfortunately, few materials can fulfill this requirement in a cost effective way while maintaining other desired physical properties (such as, deformability). This Phase II project will solve the century-long problem through the use of a two-way shape memory polymer (2W-SMP) based sealant that addresses the root cause. Building upon the feasibility study of the Phase I project, the Phase II project will focus on further improving the 2W-SMP based sealant for sealing joints or cracks in pavement, and validate the product through third-party lab-scale testing, and full-scale field-level verification in both hot and humid environment and extremely cold regions. Technical outcome will include lab-scale validation, field level performance and verification, and construction protocols for this new smart material, laying a solid foundation for adoption by home owners and transportation agencies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate compatibility of a novel polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) composite coating with metal-polymer bearings currently on the market, scale up the coating deposition process, and implement pilot processing lines. Currently, there is a need for a method to improve adhesion at the PTFE/metal interface while also reducing corrosion, friction, and wear. The implementation of this technology will aid in the transition from traditional lubricants to solid lubricants in manufacturing and has significant implications for the US economy and the environment. Currently, annual lubrication-related maintenance costs are as high as $1 trillion, and consumption of petroleum-based lubricants is estimated to reach 43.78 million metric tons as of 2016. The effective implementation of this technology will reduce maintenance costs and downtime by eliminating premature bearing failure. This project will serve as a proof point for the adoption of nano-coating technologies for reducing friction and wear in mechanical systems. It will also reduce barriers to entry for these coatings in industries dominated by outdated lubrication practices. The total applicable market size for metal-polymer bearings is estimated to be $1.0 billion, and a substantial near-term revenue opportunity for the proposed technology in this sector will be the focus of this effort. This beachhead opportunity serves as an industry validation point for the proposed technology and an entry point to other industrial and manufacturing applications.

    The intellectual merit of this project is based on improving the adhesion and mechanical properties of PTFE liners in metal-polymer bearings using an adhesive biomimetic polymer. This technology increases the wear-life of PTFE coatings, allowing for applications from which they have historically been precluded due to high wear and delamination. During Phase I, the proof of concept was established through demonstration of strong adhesion, 40% reduction in friction, 80% reduction in wear and elimination of susceptibility to corrosion in current metal-polymer bearings. The focus of Phase II will be in tailoring the coatings for specific product applications and implementation. The proposed SBIR Phase II work will overcome the remaining technical hurdles and validate the use of this technology as both a solution for improving the adhesion between PTFE and substrates and as a replacement for current PTFE liners in metal-polymer bearings. The execution of this project will allow the realization of critical proof points needed by industrial partners and speed the adoption of this technology into product lines.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the development of new carbon dioxide utilization technology for the commercialization of onsite gas production. The impediment to electrochemical carbon dioxide utilization technology has been the lack of an electrolyzer design capable of high production rates and high energy efficiency. This project will yield a novel electrolyzer component to overcome these challenges and demonstrate that cost-effective carbon dioxide utilization is possible. This component can be integrated into existing electrolyzer designs, and will enable such hardware to convert carbon dioxide into specialty gases. The resulting solution will have higher safety and lower cost than conventional packaged gas. Long term, this technology could be scaled up to higher volume applications, and used as a means of converting industrial carbon dioxide emissions into useful chemicals and fuels, thereby transforming a waste product into a new revenue stream. This scalable technology could therefore be the basis for the creation of new economic value and advanced manufacturing jobs in the United States, while providing a profitable way for existing U.S. industries to reduce their emissions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will build upon the promising feasibility results achieved in Phase I to increase the performance of a novel carbon dioxide electrochemical cell along key performance dimensions, in order to deliver a commercially-relevant, cost-competitive solution. A viable solution to derive specialty gases from a low-cost feedstock like carbon dioxide will need to have high performance on several dimensions: energy efficiency, high reaction rates, long lifetime, and low capital cost. It will also need to operate at a scale that is industrially relevant. In Phase II, the novel electrochemical component will be scaled up to commercial dimensions, and the performance of the component will be optimized to meet the performance requirements identified during customer interviews. The final component will form the basis for a commercial unit, capable of producing specialty gases from carbon dioxide at cost-competitive rates. It will lay the foundation for future scale-up to even larger membrane areas, which will enable industrial-scale applications of this carbon dioxide conversion technology. Carbon dioxide emissions could be converted into valuable products using this technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to enhance infrastructure for research and education by exposing a previously unavailable dataset: fine-grained human interaction with a physical environment. Humans are always building on and shaping the world but there is little hard data to further examine the effects this has. Beyond retail, this technology could affect how teachers layout classrooms, how disaster workers provide relief, or how factories keep their workers safe. The subtle physical details that affect humans everyday will be understood and investigated in ways not possible without the proposed system. This technology will benefit society by increasing economic efficiency because retailers can meet customer needs more easily. This translates into large potential commercial value because of the size of the retail market and because retailers are under pressure to deliver differentiated customer experiences that customers cannot get online or at big-box stores. Such experiences are enabled by understanding the customer at a much deeper level which in turn is enabled by the technology proposed here.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project uses sensor placement models, statistical methods, and face recognition to fully realize the commercial potential resulting from the Phase I development of a video analytics system for understanding human behavior. Research in video-based behavior recognition has seen renewed excitement because of deep learning but current work only addresses pieces of the problem. Critical missing components are robust face identification and registration, a process to install as few cameras as possible while maximizing the viewable area of a store, and video analysis results that are meaningful when combined with other data such as retail transactions. The research objectives of extracting biometric data (such as facial features) from video, automatically computing the optimal positions of cameras, and correlating behavior metrics with business operations are essential to improve the retail experience for shoppers and make the developments undertaken in Phase I more commercially relevant to potential end users of the technology.

    the development of the next generation of contact lenses for vision correction
    based on a novel photomodification technique called \"LIRIC (Laser Induced Refractive
    Index Change).\" More than 2.3 billion people world-wide suffer from refractive
    error in their visual system, while over 500 million have inadequate access to
    refractive correction. Glasses are an option for refractive correction, however
    there can be practical limitations and even social stigma associated with wearing
    glasses, particularly among adolescents. Meanwhile vision correction with contact
    lenses is limited to lenses whose optical prescription is determined by their
    thickness profile. This has negative consequences for visual quality, on-eye stability
    and corneal health. The research represents a fundamental shift in how vision
    correction is applied because it alters the refractive index of an optical material,
    enabling previously unavailable visual correctors in thin, stable contact lenses.
    LIRIC uses a high repetition rate, femtosecond laser to micro-modify the local
    medium to produce custom refractive corrections in hydrogels, and in living cornea.
    LIRIC works by accumulating localized refractive index (RI) changes in an ocular
    material to create a refractive lateral gradient index lens. \n\nChanging the
    refractive index using LIRIC instead of the surface shape can lead to several
    fundamental advances for vision correction, with profound implications for vision
    care: 1) contact lenses can be manufactured specifically for patient fit and stability
    with the refractive correction decoupled from the lens shape; 2) difficult and
    irregular refractive corrections (i.e. for irregular astigmatism, presbyopia,
    and higher order aberrations) could be written more easily and with better spatial
    resolution than with existing methods; 3) multifocal and diffractive optical designs
    can be utilized for presbyopic and macular degenerative corrections. Patients
    viewing through LIRIC lenses, created in Phase I, had visual performance (visual
    acuity and contrast sensitivity) on par with a control lens. The objective of
    the Phase II work is to demonstrate that LIRIC works in contact lenses at process
    speeds necessary for commercial manufacturing. The goal of this work is to demonstrate
    that a 6.5 mm optical zone can be successfully processed in <15 seconds. To effectively
    do so, the LIRIC process has to achieve more than 1 wave of phase change (at 555
    nm wavelength) at laser scanning velocities in excess of 10 meter/second."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop novel algorithms for electrodynamic simulations in commercial clouds. Electrodynamic simulation is essential for computational prototyping in optical and radio-frequency devices. Current commercial solutions require significant upfront investment of both software and hardware. They also suffer from low productivity due to limited in-house computing resources. This project will develop a cloud-based simulation service which will provide on-demand, pay-per-use, virtually unlimited simulation capability without requiring users to purchase any hardware or software. This simulation technology will greatly improve productivity, reduce the barrier to entry, and minimize cost in the design of optical and radio-frequency applications. Moreover, it will serve multiple scientific and engineering disciplines and will facilitate the use of high-performance simulation in all phases of scientific discovery and engineering design. It will revolutionize large-scale scientific simulation and allow anyone with internet access to gain unprecedented simulation power. Ultimately, this technology will help accelerate research and development in the health, energy, and defense industries by offering intuitive, on-demand, and practically infinitely scalable scientific software to engineers and scientists at a price-point significantly lower than any other cloud computing service.

    There is currently no electromagnetic simulation software which performs efficiently in commercial clouds, because they were written under the assumption that the underlying computing platform is homogenous and has low inter-CPU communication time, i.e. low latency. Starting from the most fundamental level of space-time discretization, we will develop the first electrodynamic simulation software that is latency-tolerant and cloud-optimized. The work completed in Phase I developed several proof-of-concept cloud-based electrodynamic solvers and demonstrated that commercial cloud computing platform is a viable option for offering extremely low cost computing. The general solver to be developed in Phase II will serve a broad set of applications, and will be commercialized as the electromagnetic simulation service in the cloud, featuring a fully immersive web-based visualization interface.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project, if successful, will be the development of a probiotic treatment that may be used to reduce or eliminates Salmonella and other infections in poultry. The recent FDA Veterinary Feed Directive will result in the use of antibiotics being phased out of livestock production. New technologies are needed to control pathogens in the absence of antibiotics. The goal of this technology is the reduction of pathogens in pre-harvest poultry, which may result in safer food and reduced foodborne illnesses.  In addition, this technology may help reduce the amount of antibiotics used in poultry production, which has been cited as a major factor in the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

    This SBIR Phase II project will result in the development of novel antimicrobial technologies using probiotics engineered to produce antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small proteins with remarkable bactericidal properties. During Phase I, probiotics were built successfully and tested as AMP-delivery vehicles. Probiotics are bile-resistant microorganisms that can be provided to animals safely in their food or water.  The antimicrobial probiotics will be used to test the reduction of pathogens in poultry guts. Pathogens in poultry guts are considered the major source of contamination of poultry meat during processing. The engineered probiotics will use synthetic DNA promoter regions that are designed to precisely control the delivery of AMPs at the site of infection.  The impact will be examined in field trials of probiotics with controllable AMP delivery on poultry challenged by Salmonella enteritidis and Campylobacter jejuni, two common foodborne pathogens. Antimicrobial probiotics also will be tested against Clostridia perfringens, the causal agent of poultry necrotic enteritis, an illness that causes billions of dollars in productivity losses every year in the US.

    to the end user. With the spread of compact wearable and consumer devices, battery
    space is becoming increasingly at a premium, strongly incentivizing lower power
    electronics. As this technology matures, the expanding interconnection of devices
    (aka, the Internet of Things) offers yet greater potential. With rapidly expanding
    market adoption of wireless connectivity for sensing, control, and data collection,
    power consumption is becoming a major limiter in device deployment. If lower power
    transceivers are available, wired devices may be replaced by wireless and battery
    replacement cycles reduced or even done away with altogether, saving time and
    money, and paving the way to true interconnection of all things. \n\nThe work
    of this Phase II SBIR project will focus on designing and verifying performance
    of the MEMS-based radios using fabrication processes suitable for mass production
    and commercial distribution. By combining MEMS technology with traditional circuit
    design, the proposed system will enable a 10x reduction in power consumption,
    low enough that these radios will allow extended operation on battery power alone.
    In the phase I project, the feasibility of the MEMS-based receiver was tested
    using resonators compatible with currently available MEMS foundry processes, and
    power consumption of the core radio-frequency transceiver components was verified
    at a low 300 mW. In phase II, these results will be expanded upon to add the additional
    transceiver components and software stack needed for a complete commercial product.
    The resultant design will be then transferred to the commercial foundry processes
    needed for mass production. The end goal of this project is to demonstrate a complete
    MEMS-based radio compatible with the widely-used Bluetooth Low-Energy protocol
    while operating on a total of only 2 mW in receive-mode."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project will continue development of a non-resorbable surgical film which prevents internal tissue-attachment. The proposed device will improve post-surgical outcomes from patients who suffer from internal tissue-attachment triggered by cardiothoracic or neurological surgery. Patients who undergo surgery are at risk for developing unwanted tissue-attachment due to trauma as a result of surgical intervention. This tissue-attachment can lead to severe complications and increase the burden of post-operative care resulting additional expenditures through extended hospital stays, readmissions, and increased morbidity and mortality rates. In addition, undesirable tissue attachment can obstruct the surgical field upon re-operation when necessary. Surgical related tissue-attachment is a problem amongst many surgical procedures in a number of areas. However, cardiothoracic and neurological procedures are often more complicated than gastrointestinal or gynecologic procedures, making any complications more expensive and risky to providers, payers and patients. Additionally, re-operations in cardiac or neuro-spine cases are extremely difficult, which underscore the need for an effective solutions to prevent this malady even more urgent. A product that can effectively prevent undesirable tissue-attachment and provide the surgeon with a clear surgical field and plane of view would be highly desirable in both cardio-thoracic and neurological surgery.

    The proposed project will conduct additional pre-clinical work leading to a regulatory submission for a cardio-thoracic indication and additional validation within the neurological field. Positive animal studies completed during Phase I & IB efforts revealed the capacity of the Sintact Film? to reduce tissue attachment and provide for a clear field of view upon re-entry or re-operation. Initial Phase II work will examine the feasibility of scaling-up certain manufacturing and production processes resulting in a clinical grade product which will undergo sterility, safety, animal, biocompatibility, and mechanical testing. This testing will be compared directly to a predicate or equivalent approved medical device. Results will need to show equivalency of the Sintact Film? to the predicate device across all testing metrics. Additional Phase II work will enable further validation of the Sintact Film? for neurological indications. A larger definitive neurological study will be completed to address the capability of the Sintact Film? to be deployed effectively in a neurological setting. Positive results from this study will provide a basis for pursuing expanded indications and additional market opportunities. If successful the implications that a non-resorbable product can be an effective countermeasure in these areas would alter the current methodology in the field.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop natural alternatives to synthetic chemicals that are used to impart color to food, medicine, and cosmetics. Negative health impacts of some high volume synthetic colorants are driving demand for natural and safe colorants that are obtained from biological sources. This project will advance the commercial feasibility of a class of naturally occurring pigments that have properties of color, functionality, stability, and safety that make them attractive as food colorants. Based on six years of prior university research, a potentially suitable botanical source of a red pigment has been identified.  The goal of this project is to develop a commercial process to produce the pigment from this botanical source. The pigment will be tested as a replacement for a synthetic red pigment that has been widely used as a food additive.  The goal is to provide a natural alternative to reduce the health risks associated with artificial colorants.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a naturally occurring red pigment from a plant source as an alternative food color additive.  Phase I demonstrated that the red pigment could be extracted at small-scale and performed well in food applications.  The goal of this Phase II project is to scale up commercial processes for extraction and purification of this red pigment, and to conduct further performance testing. The pigment, which previously has not been available in commercial quantities, will be produced from a selected variety of a major crop species. The goal is to develop processes to scale pigment production under conditions that will validate a commercial scale.  This will include the integration of mechanical separation, food grade extraction, and various commercially-available clarification systems. The products will be tested for performance characteristics and consistency of quality during scale up by examining thermal, pH, and light stability in a range of probable food and other applications.  In addition, yield produced will be evaluated to validate economic competitiveness.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to combat modern day slavery in the United States and Canada. In this project the company will go beyond the public sector, selling its capabilities to the hospitality industry, which shares a role in tackling this problem. Banks also play a part in detecting financial transactions which stem from criminal revenue streams. These new markets expand the revenue opportunity and social impact of the technology. The proposed Phase II research and development will solve huge challenges voiced by the company's law enforcement users. The deployment of these research products through a platform that enables evidence management and collaboration will accelerate the impact by increasing communication among the fragmented law enforcement jurisdictions in the United States. This will enable agencies to conduct more effective investigations, and empower them to take on larger cases involving organized crime across state lines. Finally, human expertise will be developed within the company and through its partnership with Carnegie Mellon University to commercialize advanced computing research for real-world, social impact. These innovations will empower more victim rescues and exploiter prosecutions. The project will create a culture within the company to nurture engineers in social entrepreneurship.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will expand on machine learning technology created in Phase I to deobfuscate escort ads and implement end-to-end innovations for investigations. Each day, there are thousands of online data points related to prostitution. Hidden behind this content are victims of sex trafficking, those forced or coerced into sex work, including juveniles who have not reached the age of consent. Big Data presents the opportunity to seize this information to disrupt traffickers and organized groups who drive the cycle of exploitation. The company's research objectives include maximizing evidence recall using sophisticated crawlers and deobfuscation methods, as well as generating leads using natural language processing and multi-modal machine learning. The project will further develop computer vision capabilities to interpret features of an image and enable visual search for missing victims. It will formalize methods for collecting ground truth, preventing false positives, and diagnosing algorithmic performance relevant to users' needs. Finally, the company will deploy this research into accessible software products that provide real-time, digestible, and actionable information to law enforcement, resulting in the rescue of hundreds, or potentially thousands, of sex trafficking victims.

    develop copper based pastes for the metallization of silicon solar cells. Photovoltaics
    (PV) offer an opportunity for clean and affordable energy and over the past decade
    the PV industry has seen annual compound growth rates of over 50%. Although revenues
    are high, the profit margins for many manufacturers have substantially diminished,
    necessitating the need for cutbacks throughout the value chain. One area marked
    for cost reduction, is in the metallization of the solar cells, which now commands
    nearly 10 percent of the world's supply. Having the cost of photovoltaic panels
    tied to a precious metal with price volatility can lead to higher prices for renewable
    energy; thus replacing silver with copper is a significant opportunity for the
    industry. Thus the outcomes of this project would be a product for making solar
    energy more affordable. The project also includes creating two new full time positions
    in Kentucky in Advanced Research and Manufacturing. This proposal will enhance
    scientific understanding of the copper-silicon contact formation and durability
    of the material during operation. \n\nThe technological feasibility of the copper
    pastes with an inherent diffusion barrier was demonstrated on standard and bifacial
    solar cells in Phase I. Phase II will further improve the screen printable pastes
    to industry standards. To achieve the high electrical performance required in
    this market, the project will investigate the copper-silicon interface to investigate
    the mechanisms involved during contact formation, and the chemical nature of the
    copper-silicon interface. This information will be used to optimize the chemical
    composition and thermal treatment of the pastes to improve electrical performance
    and cell lifetime. The pastes will be optimized for industrial operating equipment
    to provide the manufacturer with a product that can be dropped in, with minimal
    changes to the production line. Phase II will also involve scale up of the core
    materials in the pastes to be able to engage customers in further printing trials.
    Through the assembly and testing of prototype solar cell modules, the durability
    of the copper contacts will be demonstrated. The outcomes of this proposal will
    be screen printable copper pastes that can be direct drop in replacement for the
    silver pastes; thereby enhancing the profit margins of the solar cell manufacturer."

    Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is far-reaching in terms of improving the quality
    of life and the cost/efficacy of healthcare for more than 20 Million people in
    the USA. We address the need for better methods for identifying and guiding the
    treatment of ambulatory patients with dangerous heart dysfunctions such as intermittent
    arrhythmias and heart failure. For example, atrial fibrillation arrhythmia afflicts
    nearly 8 Million patients in the USA, approximately 460,000 new patients every
    year, and the patient load is projected to grow to 12.1 million by 2050. The disease
    and its complications (stroke, congestive heart failure, seizures, death, etc.)
    add $26B to the nation's annual healthcare costs. Heart Failure currently afflicts
    nearly 5.7 Million people in the US growing to 8 Million by 2030. Their treatment
    and frequent hospitalization costs are already at 14B$ and will grow to 29B$ by
    2030.  Together with reducing the economic impacts, it would be of an enormous
    benefit to human health to create a device that improves the diagnosis and guides
    effective therapy for these patients while they remain fully ambulatory and going
    about their normal activities outside the expensive confines of the hospital.\n
    \ \n\nThe proposed project has the following intellectual merits. In our Phase
    I STTR program we focused on developing a wearable Atrial Fibrillation monitor
    to assist physicians in the diagnosis of paroxysmal or episodic versions of that
    disorder. In Phase II we have pivoted towards the even more critical need of ambulatory
    monitoring of paroxysmal tachycardia and eventually heart failure patients. The
    current industry standard of ambulatory ECG does not provide enough sensitivity
    or specificity to determine if the patient has atypical or typical atrial flutter,
    paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia as well as various forms of ventricular
    tachycardia. Accurately diagnosing and monitoring these disorders is critical
    to patient treatment and outcomes. Our device will be capable of ambulatory patient
    monitoring for any sort of arrhythmia, and we believe it can be the preferred
    choice for all portable monitoring if it provides in one device ECG, heart motion
    and breathing rate/pattern/volume. So, the overarching technical research goal
    of our Phase II work is to develop a full featured prototype cardiac motion sensor
    as described above that can be used for initial clinical tests. These features
    include: wearable, battery powered, signal storage, cardiac motion from radar,
    disposable antenna, onboard ECG, and breathing rate."

    ideal product yields and purities of 95+% and 99+% respectively. Throughout all

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project is to produce economically the next generation of sustainable, renewable, clean burning, high energy density, transportation biofuels. The proposed technology once successfully developed will enable existing biofuel producers to reduce their costs while increasing the value and diversity of their byproducts. It will convert their industrial waste products into tailored fatty acids suitable for biodiesel. The technology will be compatible with and complementary to cellulosic ethanol producers, and it could potentially double the amount of biodiesel produced in the U.S. today. The 227 domestic ethanol plants range in size from less than 50 to more than 150 million gallons, and they have a total annual capacity of 15 billion gallons. Every gallon of ethanol also yields 1.9 pounds of soluble organics that must be evaporated or disposed. Xylome?s technology has the potential to convert half of this stream into biodiesel and to expand biodiesel production further with cellulosic feedstocks. By converting a larger fraction of the soluble cellulosic and hemicellulosic sugars along with fermentation byproducts, Xylome will increase the efficiency of existing ethanol plants and increase biofuel production.

    The objectives of this Phase II research are to increase the rates of production, modification and release of fatty acids from non-conventional lipogenic yeast.  Fatty acids have much higher energy density than ethanol, but similar specific energy yields. Fermentation of organics to lipids can potentially occur with efficiencies equivalent to ethanol production. Lipids normally accumulate under nitrogen limiting conditions after replication has stopped. They are not excreted from the cells so recovery does not require distillation. In Phase I, Xylome scientists identified and over expressed genes that increase lipid accumulation by 1.2- to 2-fold under high nitrogen conditions. In Phase II, they will use mating, selection, screening and evolutionary adaptation to combine the best of these modifications. Xylome scientists have also targeted additional genes to modify and release fatty acids from the cell. Xylome plans to optimize lipid production both from a cellular level with metabolic engineering and from an engineering perspective through bioprocess design and cultivation conditions. Xylome will also engineer cells to use rapidly the complex mixture of soluble oligosaccharides, hemicellulosic sugars and fermentation byproducts. By applying advanced molecular techniques and synthetic biology, Xylome will open up new opportunities for sustainable biofuel production.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to improve wheat yield globally by deploying newly developed, region-specific dwarfing genes. World population is predicted to grow to 9.6 billion by 2050. Wheat demand is expected to increase also due to a shift from rice to wheat consumption due to an expected increase in wealth around the globe. The increased wheat demand will have to be met under less land area and changing climate. Water use efficiency and increase in wheat yields will be important factors in meeting this demand. The proposed technology is poised to increase wheat yield under abiotic stress conditions. All of these benefits are expected to have a major positive impact on humanity.  The wheat seed business is currently valued at up to $8.3 billion. The proposed technology will provide a competitive advantage to capture a significant market share of the wheat seed industry while contributing positively towards food security during the changing climate.

    This SBIR phase II project proposes to further develop and test alternative dwarfing genes to improve wheat yield and abiotic stress tolerance around the globe. Responsible for the "green-revolution," dwarfing genes are required to obtain higher yields, but the two dwarfing genes present in more than 90% of the currently grown wheat varieties have serious ill-effects including abiotic stress sensitivity, reduced root length and biomass, seedling emergence, and vigor. During the Phase I research, four new dwarfing genes were identified and shown to be significantly better than the currently used genes. Phase II will focus on the comparison of the new genes with the old genes to show their true benefits. This research also will generate valuable data required for the development of "release-ready" varieties.  Genetic background effects will be studied by transferring one of the new dwarfing genes into two different backgrounds followed by field and controlled condition evaluation. Future competitive advantage will be maintained by pyramiding the new dwarfing genes with complementary gene action. Closely linked DNA markers will be developed for an efficient transfer of the technology into diverse backgrounds.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is in support of Branch Technology's novel Additive Manufacturing (AM) process that combines 3D printing technology and conventional construction materials to enable a new way to create buildings. The construction market in the US is approximately 8% of GDP.  Any portion of the market that could be enhanced would have a large impact in the US economy.  To that end, Branch is creating a process similar to building found in the natural world.  In the formation of natural systems, material is the most expensive commodity; a structure is derived by the efficient use of material, but shape is free to be created in almost any form.  Branch can approach this efficiency with additive manufacturing, where form is created and material is deposited only when needed and little waste is created. At the core of Branch's method of AM-based construction are three key developments: a three-dimensional freeform structure (the cellular matrix or lattice) which serves as a scaffold for other materials, a robotically- controlled extrusion mechanism by which the cellular matrix is produced, and the algorithms necessary to control the robot for successful production.  The proof of concept for this process and more have already been demonstrated by Branch in Phase I of this grant.

    The technical objectives for Phase II focus on improving the procedures and technology already created. The focus areas for this phase are algorithm development, hardware improvements, the application of finishing materials, code compliance testing, and material science experiments. Algorithm development consists of refining and creating the software necessary to extrude the printed matrix and support a client base. Hardware improvements are necessary to improve the speed and efficiency of the process to create a commercially viable workflow. This research will necessitate the purchase of extra hardware for experimentation.  American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) testing for load bearing capacity is necessary to enter the market and provide code compliant construction. Experimentation in the application of finished materials to the 3D printed lattice such as spray foam and concrete are vital to the realization of complete buildings.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
    Transfer (STTR) Phase II project, in which a non-invasive respiratory muscle stimulation
    device and approach to weaning patients from mechanical ventilation will be developed,
    is a reduction in public health care expenditure and a reduction in morbidity
    for the half a million patients who have difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation
    each year in the US. These patients suffer from an array of clinical complications
    (for example, pneumonia) and cost the US health care system $16 billion annually,
    a great deal of which is borne by Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, the current
    reimbursement landscape economically incentivizes hospitals to wean patients at
    the earliest possible time. The proposed innovation has the potential to positively
    benefit society by providing a solution to this serious healthcare problem. In
    addition, it promises to improve our scientific understanding of respiratory muscle
    physiology and mechanics in difficult to wean patients. It will also improve our
    technical understanding of non-invasive respiratory sensors and biofeedback algorithms
    for the purposes of electrical muscle stimulation. Finally, as demonstrated by
    the number and cost of difficult to wean patients, as well as current healthcare
    reimbursement policies, the proposed innovation has potential to results in a
    considerable commercial impact.  \n \nThe proposed project will develop a non-invasive
    electrical stimulator that automatically applies stimulation to the respiratory
    muscles in synchrony with a patient?s voluntary breathing pattern. This approach
    is expected to address the imbalance between respiratory muscle strength and respiratory
    muscle load - a major factor responsible for weaning difficulty - by assisting
    ventilation during weaning sessions and strengthening the breathing muscles that
    have become weakened as a result of mechanical ventilation. In Phase 1 a functional
    prototype was developed; clinical feasibility of the approach was also demonstrated.
    \ The Phase II proposal focuses on refining the stimulation algorithm to maximize
    its clinical effectiveness and on developing a novel stimulation electrode system
    so that the device can be quickly applied to patients. In addition, methods will
    be developed to interface the technology with a mechanical ventilator to expand
    its clinical application. Finally, a complete works-like, looks-like prototype
    will be developed that is designed to international standards and is safe for
    clinical testing. The work completed in this Phase of the project will enable
    a controlled clinical trial of the proposed approach and ultimately allow the
    device to gain FDA regulatory clearance."

    adaptive online learning platform founded on the principles of adaptive learning.
    The online learning system provides adaptive learning strategies with real-time
    learner analytics. The system integrates learner analytics from four dimensional
    aspects of learning: multi-media, learning strategies, interactivity, and social
    interaction-- to deliver a personalized learning experience for science, technology,
    engineering, and math (STEM) students for significant improvement in the learning
    outcome. The adaptive learning software technology platforms with personalized
    learning strategies have demonstrated high completion and satisfaction rates for
    online students taking post-secondary courses. In this SBIR Phase II we propose
    to develop a unique data driven decision support interface that will result in
    real-time big data analytics for both individuals and large numbers of learners.
    The volume, velocity, variety, and veracity (the 4 Vs of big data) will be generated
    by the collection of data at individual schools first, with the potential to aggregate
    data from district, state, and even national levels.  The big-data analytics of
    the learner trajectories through the adaptive learning platform will uncover patterns
    that can improve understanding of learner behavior in education.  \n\nBig data,
    generated by the adaptive learning systems related to learner behavior in each
    learning strategy, will lead to valuable insights on efficacy of the proposed
    methodology and further development of the product on mobile platforms in the
    Phase II.  The learner analytics will provide the basis for intelligent feedback
    based on the statistical evidence.  The proposed method of data driven decision
    process for adaptive learning is based on the real- time cross-correlation statistical
    analysis of the predictor variables for an individual learner.  The field trials
    of the proposed method will be conducted in the participating high schools.  Collection
    of data for a group of students collected during the field trials in high schools
    will lead to discovery of learning patterns for the clusters of learners in each
    learning strategy. The previous Phase I research has led to the development of
    an analytical model for volume, velocity, variety, and veracity of data collected
    at school-wide level.  This reports form this data is used for the development
    of decision tree and regression analysis to find correlations (knowledge discovery)
    that can be used for the improvement of learning enterprise (school). The data-driven
    feedback to students and the group analytics for teachers will provide necessary
    feedback mechanism for improving competency and graduation rates for STEM education
    in schools and colleges."

- abstractText: "This Phase II project aims to develop software to automatically assess
    public speaking skills and prepare students with better oral communications skills
    necessary to perform job tasks. Oral expression is the most highly valued ability
    throughout the economy and ranks as the second most highly-valued skill for high-wage,
    high-growth, high-skill occupations. Approximately 4.5 million college students
    take a basic communications course each year, however, as class sizes get larger
    and online learning becomes more common, public speaking instruction becomes increasingly
    difficult.  Practice and feedback are essential aspects of these courses, yet
    it is a struggle for teachers to find enough time to sufficiently interact with
    students. This SBIR project aims to develop the key concepts of automated public
    speaking assessment such that a student?s vocal delivery can be objectively measured
    and presented in a manner that creates an independent, personalized learning experience.
    Unlike traditional methods of public speaking assessment, the proposed system
    can be available at any time, provide objective feedback and track student practice
    and improvement. The proposed Software-as-a-Service is projected to generate $16
    Million in revenue over five years and create more than 25 high-paying, US-based
    jobs. \n\n\nThis Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes
    to develop an automated assessment system for public speaking that determines
    how a speaker would be perceived by an audience.  Automated assessment for speech
    has already occurred in spoken language proficiency, which leverages Automated
    Speech Recognition (ASR) and semantic analysis. Automated voice assessment has
    also been utilized in lie detection and emotion detection, which focus on autonomic
    responses in the user?s voice, such as when stress affects the vocal cords. The
    hypothesis behind this SBIR project is that speakers can consciously use and modify
    non-semantic speech behaviors to produce more desirable listener perceptions.
    Automatically linking listener perception to speech behaviors represents a novel
    direction in automated assessment for speech. The Phase II objective is to develop
    software sufficient for automated public speaking assessment such that a student?s
    vocal delivery can be objectively measured and presented in a manner that creates
    an independent, personalized learning experience. Voice analytics capability investigated
    in Phase I will be enhanced and developed into a cloud-based service which helps
    students practice, track, and improve their public speaking habits."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will be to improve cleaning in the food processing industry by integrating hyper-stable enzymes into cleaning products. Industrial enzymes are a growing, multi-billion dollar green industry that reduces energy, water, and harsh chemical use while improving process efficiency in many sectors. Despite the broad use and success of industrial enzymes, their application and economic impact has been severely limited by narrow thermal and chemical operational ranges available. The company has developed heat and acid stable enzymes that significantly expand the reach of enzyme applications. The goal is to develop an initial product for the dairy cleaning market that will have the potential to increase production due to faster cleaning, achieve better removal of protein contaminants and biofilms, reduce water usage, and reduce food product exposure to chemicals and chemical waste. Better cleaning with enzymes has the potential to prevent food-borne illness, and decrease water use, while increasing food-processing profits and providing a biodegradable alternative to chemical cleaners.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of using the first practical protein expression platform to produce hyperstable enzymes for commercial use. Although the genes from extreme organisms have been studied for over forty years, their commercial potential has not been realized due to their incompatibility with traditional protein expression systems. The unique hyperstability of enzymes produced using the company's technologies indicate that enzyme stability is not encoded entirely by gene sequence. In Phase II, the goal is to develop more comprehensive cleaning formulations and test these with laboratory and field trial methods established in Phase I. The project encompasses a set of integrated experiments spanning molecular biology, microbiology, biochemistry, dairy processor field trials, and practical industrial bioprocess optimization. The aim is to transform the world's most extreme enzymes into the world's most effective products for membrane defouling and sanitation in the dairy industry and beyond.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in developing a novel method of manufacturing
    micro sized parts in three-dimensions without layers at high volume.  With no
    parting lines, the technology represents a significant advancement over current
    state of the art molding and 3D technologies for certain applications.  As this
    represents an entirely new field of research, not merely an extension of solid
    freeform fabrication (SFF) techniques, it opens and enables wide research areas
    in engineering and chemical disciplines.  More imminent is using the technology
    to create capillary electrophoresis (CE) chips that vastly reduce the amount of
    reagents, provide previously unattainable properties, and at a significantly lower
    price.  By doing so, the technology will accelerate and broaden the adoption of
    microfluidics which are currently used in applications such as forensics, genomics,
    drug making, drug analysis, clinical diagnostics, biosensors, and environmental
    testing, among countless others. \n \n\nThis project automates and expands a novel
    platform technology to manufacture high resolution micro parts. The technology
    is focused on a unique and inexpensive method to fabricate microfluidic channels
    and wells, which form the basis of all microfluidic chips. The objectives for
    Phase II are to: 1) Expand the versatility of the system by inclusion to the platform
    system of fiber optic cables, temperature control capillaries, microfluidic design
    of static mixer and expansion of molding materials, 2) Design and construct a
    pilot automation system to increase control and reduce variability, 3) Test the
    automation system, 4) Test chips produced via the automated system and test additional
    versatility components from (1), and 5) Continue to commercialize the products.
    The technological outcome is an automated system with expanded versatility that
    will center on the construction of capillary electrophoresis chips, with the objective
    of making the system on that can manufacture a wide variety of microfluidic chips."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to offer custom crafted digital voices for text-to-speech applications. Each one of us has a unique voiceprint - an essential part of our self-identity. Though the quality of text-to-speech technology has improved, voice options remain limited. For the 2.5 million Americans (and tens of millions worldwide) living with voicelessness who rely on devices to talk, access to a custom digital voice is a game changer. It's the difference between a functional solution and being heard, uniquely, as oneself. Enhanced opportunities for social connection increase quality of life, independence, and access to educational and vocational resources that can narrow the gap between those with and without disability. This immediate unmet societal need, coupled with the increasing proliferation of devices that speak to us and for us, creates a compelling, timely and significant commercial opportunity for high quality, personalized digital voices that can be produced at scale. By leveraging the company's crowdsourced human voicebank and proprietary voice matching and blending algorithms the technology has the potential to empower everyone to express themselves through their own voice.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project builds on the company's NSF-funded research and Phase I results that support feasibility and commercialization of a customized voice building technology. The text-to-speech market, encompassing assistive technologies, enterprise and consumer applications, is currently valued at around $1B and is rapidly growing and ripe for innovation. To create custom voices, the company leverages the source-filter theory of speech production. From those who are unable or unwilling to record several hours of speech the company extracts a brief vocal sample - even a single vowel contains enough 'vocal DNA' to seed the personalization process. Identity cues of the source are then combined with filter properties of a demographically and acoustically matched donor in the company's voicebank. The result is a voice that captures the vocal identity of the recipient but the clarity of the donor. Phase II technical objectives address the need for 1) customer-driven voice customization, 2) quality assurance of crowdsourced recordings, 3) voice aging algorithms, and 4) targeted donor recruitment algorithms. These advances will help secure the assistive technology beachhead and spur innovations for broader applications such as virtual reality, personal robotics, and digital persona for the Internet of Things.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to produce a new type of computer memory called Ferroelectric Dynamic Random Access Memory (FEDRAM). FEDRAM is cheap and can be mass-produced in current semiconductor manufacturing facilities. It also uses much less energy than current-state-of-the-art memories, and enables electronic devices to be much smaller in physical size. Commercially, FEDRAM works best as an embedded memory, which means they are ideally suited for products such as mobile phones where the processor and memory are on the same chip. Additionally, the same block of FEDRAM can be configured for high performance applications in addition to longer storage applications. This means that future devices will adapt to maximize power, performance, and usability. Due to the factors of price, performance, and low power, once FEDRAM is proven to work, it can potenitally be adopted in nearly every electronic device.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the commercialization questions of Ferroelectric Dynamic Random Access Memory (FEDRAM).  In SBIR Phase I, it was shown that FEDRAM cells can be manufactured in an existing foundry with no new materials or equipment changes, and that FEDRAM has leading performance characteristics. The next step is to prove the same characteristics in an array, which would be considered a minimum viable product; this is the goal of SBIR Phase II. By proving this array,  it will be possible to quickly scale the FEDRAM memory array into embedded applications for commercial deployment.  The performance characteristics to be demonstrated are read/write latency, switching time, endurance, retention, and energy use.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to provide the paint and coatings industry with new high-performance, cost-competitive polymer/resin systems that reduce solvent emissions and use of petrochemicals.  In addition, these new polymer/resin systems enable one-component, ambient-cure coatings to be produced.  This means that highly protective coatings can be produced without the need for mixing multiple components together prior to application or applying heat or light to cure the coatings.  The one-component, ambient-cure features of these polymer/resin systems largely eliminate waste and energy costs associated with coating application and lend themselves to the production of paints and coatings that can be applied by the average person.  Compared to the current state-of-the-art in one-component, ambient-cured resins, these new polymer/resin systems provide dramatically shorter drying times, dramatically better chemical resistance, and much higher film hardness, while exhibiting excellent impact resistance and flexibility.  The highly desirable properties of these new cost-competitive polymer/resin systems will enable commercial success, while their low solvent emissions and high renewable content will reduce impact on the environment.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to: 1) further optimize the polymer/resin systems to produce compositions that minimize solvent content and maximize performance, while meeting the cost constraints of the market; 2) put in place a pilot-line to provide potential customers with adequate sample sizes to enable their own evaluation of potential products, 3) generate weathering, corrosion, and storage/shelf stability data to further understand the application potential of optimized polymer/resin systems; and 4) optimize the polymer/resin production process to minimize cost and minimize production waste.  By meeting these objectives, the Phase II project will result in the generation of new polymer/resin systems that will enable the development and commercialization of new paints and coatings that are one-component, ambient-cured, low in solvent content that exhibit exceptional properties, while being primarily based on renewable materials.  Optimized polymer/resin systems will be provided to potential customers for their own internal evaluation.  If necessary, feedback from customer evaluations will be used to modify polymer/resin system composition to meet customer needs.  By the end of the Phase II project, the technology will be ready to proceed to manufacturing scale-up and product commercialization.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to
    deliver a cost-effective automated quality control (QC) system for manufacturing
    of radioactive drugs used in Positron Emission Tomography (PET). This system will
    replace current QC procedures, which involve 18 manual operations, 8 visual assessments,
    6 devices, and 8 samples of radioactive drugs. The industry's current reliance
    on manual operation, subjectivity and untraceable records impedes progress in
    radioactive drug manufacturing and presents compliance risks. Therefore, introduction
    of an automated system combining all these tests on a single platform will facilitate
    adoption of PET imaging technology beyond top tier medical centers. By addressing
    a critical current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) compliance need in radio-pharmaceutical
    production, which cannot be addressed with any other solutions available today,
    this solution is positioned for rapid adoption.  After adopting this system, it
    is expected that manufacturing facilities will realize 20% operating cost reduction
    and 50% reduction in time spent on QC-related activities. A reduced cost of compliance
    associated with introduction of automated QC will further contribute to the adoption
    rate.  This project will open the door to new applications of plate reader technology,
    an approach which has been traditionally confined to the fields of biochemistry
    and diagnostics.  \n\nThis Phase II effort includes four technical objectives.
    \ Firstly, the approach will be adapted to minimize the required sample volume.
    \ Methods developed in Phase I of the project required 0.5 ml of sample, a value
    which is not optimal for small manufacturers. To bring this value down to 0.2
    ml, test sensitivity will be adjusted, keeping in mind the potential dynamic range
    trade-offs.  Secondly, we will design a plastic consumable that supports adoption
    by a commercial manufacturer.  Current plastic prototype components are only suitable
    for academic sites with highly-skilled personnel.  To reduce the amount of training
    required, and to expand the applicability of this method, a new plastic component
    will be designed in order to further automate sample loading.  Third, we will
    optimize the formulation of the reagents to achieve a one-year shelf life for
    the consumable kit.  The shelf life of the reagents developed in Phase I remains
    unknown.  Therefore, accelerated stability studies will be performed to estimate
    the rates of decomposition processes, and appropriate changes will be made to
    enhance shelf life. Finally, we will develop a pilot production process for the
    newly-designed kit, in order to support early installations."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and produce a robust, hand-held, video-rate three-dimensional surface metrology system with vertical and lateral resolution of several micrometers, in order to bridge a critical existing metrology gap for precision-machined surfaces.  Many modern manufactured parts, such as turbine blades, drive shafts, orthopedics, and various additive manufactured components require in-situ metrology with high resolution for accurate characterization during manufacturing and/or maintenance operations.  Current high-resolution surface measurement systems are slow, vibration-sensitive and laboratory-based and thus are impractical for everyday use by manufacturing technicians.  Meanwhile, shop-floor inspection is often only visual, and thus qualitative rather than quantitative, leading both to rejections of acceptable components as well as potential acceptance of failing ones.  The absence of high-precision, in-situ metrology has hindered manufacturers from applying real-time data analysis and closed-loop process controls that can improve yields and reduce manufacturing costs.  This research program will yield a hand-held, easy-to-use, robust, and quantitative shop-floor measurement system, allowing manufacturers to improve lifetimes, performance, and yield as they rapidly assess the features under test and feed the results back to improve process control.

    During Phase I, a breadboard system was designed and implemented using a polarization-based fringe projection method and micropolarizer phase-mask technology to achieve vibration insensitive measurement in a compact package.  This Phase II program leverages that research to design a video-rate, compact, robust and portable system for handheld surface measurements in shop-floor environments. This will first involve improvements to measurement resolution with an improved optical design and new self-calibrating measurement modes; new optical elements will lower noise artifacts caused by imperfections in the earlier design and to reduce system size.  Once performance of the new design is verified, an ergonomic, compact, robust, wireless housing for the instrument must be created to enable shop-floor use; the system must handle drops of over one meter onto concrete, have useful battery life for extended field operations, be light enough to not fatigue users and have intuitive controls and feedback.  A final, critically important development effort will create automated software routines for measurement, analysis, and system diagnostics to enable adoption by unskilled personnel in manufacturing environments.  Lastly, extensive applications testing in the field will allow optimization of the system to handle a wide range of potential use cases and environments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to increase the efficiency of domestic oil production. Using current methods, the oil industry is able to extract only 5% of the known hydrocarbon from shale formation. This represents more than $500B of potential oil and gas that cannot be economically produced for the US economy. The aim is to increase the efficiency of oil production by providing novel subsurface information to improve operational decision making. The resulting value increase for a producer can be up to $1M per well. In addition, it is possible to significantly reduce the environmental impact of the hydraulic fracturing process, which is currently only 50% efficient. By providing novel subsurface data for the industry, this information can reduce environmental impact by saving up to 45B gallons of fresh water and 1M rail cars of mined sand. Furthermore, the analysis of subsurface microbiomes is a rich area for new academic knowledge.  Over 80% of the microbial strains identified in Phase I have never been documented in public references. This work not only provides economic and social value, but also expands scientific knowledge.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to use next-generation microbiome analyses to increase the efficiency of domestic oil production. The research objective is to analyze the subsurface hydrocarbon microbiome to characterize hydrocarbon reservoirs and leverage this new data source to increase current efficiency rates. The goal is to analyze 50 producing wells in the Southwestern US, and develop statistical models linking microbial profiles to key reservoir properties that can increase production efficiencies. The analytical method employed will utilize technology stemming from over $20 million in government funding to the University of Colorado used to create bioinformatics software known as "QIIME."  The QIIME technology has been extensively tested in analyzing and modeling the human microbiome, but has never been applied to the subsurface hydrocarbon microbiome prior to the Phase I work.  By combining advances in cloud computing, DNA sequencing, and novel software analytics, this project will demonstrate that these microbial communities correlate to meaningful production parameters for the oil and gas industry. In so doing, the project will demonstrate at pilot scale that this new information source can be utilized as a novel, non-invasive, low-cost reservoir characterization tool that allows the industry to maximize hydrocarbon production while minimizing environmental impact.

    on the continued development of biologically grown masonry units as a commercially-viable
    and sustainable alternative to traditional fired masonry materials.  This product
    is grown in ambient temperatures utilizing a natural calcium carbonate cement
    formation induced by a urease-producing microorganism. The Phase II project will
    focus on material testing and further optimization and cost reduction of biocement
    products, with the intention of demonstrating pilot manufacturing and rapid commercialization
    via licensee manufacturers. Using biologic products and fermentation procedures
    developed in the Phase I effort, improvements will be made to scale up manufacturing
    and reduce cost in the manufacturing process. The commercial potential of this
    technology is critically dependent on achieving cost and performance parity, if
    not superiority, with traditional materials.  Each year, 1.23 trillion fired bricks
    are produced globally for use in construction, resulting in over 800 million tons
    of carbon emissions.  The societal impacts of this research would include a dramatic
    reduction in these emissions, as well as a corresponding reduction in industrial
    by-product waste. This project will enhance the technological understanding for
    commercial viability and test data including durability and physical performance.\n
    \nTechnical objectives for this effort include evaluation of the resulting biocement
    masonry products through rigorous American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM)
    testing methods, reduction of raw material costs through continued optimization,
    creation of in-house production capability for the requisite biologic product,
    and the creation and testing of a manufacturing process suitable for transition
    to licensees. Main focus areas of the Phase II project include rigorous material
    testing for physical performance, weathering and durability, in-house production
    of robust raw material constituents, and commercial testing coupled with pilot
    manufacturing. Rigorous ASTM testing methods will be done at two accredited labs,
    and labor requirements will be reduced via the adoption of lean automation in
    the production process. Additionally, the utilization of existing material handing
    manufacturing equipment at licensee facilities, where possible, will be evaluated.
    Expected project results will include a comprehensive statistical analysis of
    multiple physical samples, as well as a corresponding failure analysis. Additional
    expected deliverables include the successful commission of in-house pilot scale
    manufacturing for biocement constituents as a simplified additive to be used by
    commercial partners and licensees."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project supports development of a nanoparticle characterization instrument that will fill the critical unmet need to rapidly and accurately measure the size and distribution of nanoparticles from 30 nanometers to 1 micron. Initially the technology will target two applications: protein aggregation in biopharmaceuticals, and nanoparticles in medicine (e.g., tumor-targeted drug delivery). The importance of nanoparticle analysis, however, goes well beyond therapeutics. Currently the market for nanoparticle analysis instrumentation across the life sciences is $5.6 billion, and there are increasing concerns about nanoparticles in consumer products such as food and cosmetics, as well as in drinking water, effluents, and the environment. A major challenge in understanding the health impacts of nanoparticles is simply in accurately and easily detecting their presence and size distribution. Additionally, improved nanoparticle instrumentation will enable new discoveries in biotechnology and environmental and health sciences.

    This challenge can be met by developing a practical method for counting and sizing submicron particles in polydisperse mixtures. NSF Phase I/IB funds supported development of a prototype instrument that detects individual nanoparticles and accurately measures their size, at very high count rates. This instrument has successfully demonstrated robust detection of individual particles as small as 60 nm in diameter at rates approaching 10,000 particles per second, and has already begun to deliver useful information to particle manufacturers in the pharmaceutical industry, with on-going measurements of actual customer samples. The Phase II support will considerably enhance the utility of this instrument by addressing several outstanding technical challenges; most significantly, by extending the range of detectable particles to span the full range from 30 nm to 1000 nm, and by further maximizing the range of measurable particle concentrations.  In addition, the Phase II work will drive significant improvements in functionality and ease of use, driven by innovations in its control software. Finally, the instrument will be further validated using a wide variety of particle types relevant beyond the pharmaceutical space.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is development of a microbial technology for the conversion of low-value sugars into high-value chemicals. Most industrial chemicals produced today are derived from petroleum and other nonrenewable raw materials. The long-term growth and sustainability of the chemical industry benefits from development of new routes to existing chemicals using renewable raw materials. Furthermore, due to higher infrastructure costs and stricter environmental requirements, many chemicals that were once produced in the United States are now produced abroad. This contributes to the U.S. trade deficit. This Phase II proposal aims to develop a fermentation technology where domestically grown agricultural materials (for example, corn and waste agricultural residues) are converted into high-value chemicals. The optimized fermentation process is estimated to be cost-competitive with the incumbent petrochemical route when scaled. If successful, this proposal will facilitate growth of a domestic bio-chemical manufacturing industry, targeting the $30 billion organic acids market.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop large-scale, high-throughput techniques to optimize gene expression in industrial yeast. A significant problem within the field of industrial biotechnology is the ability to engineer and optimize the fermentation performance of non-academic or model microbes. Most molecular metabolic engineering tools are developed for use in two model prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes, E. coli and S. cerevisiae, and are not suitable for use with industrially relevant microbes. Without these tools it is costly and slow to commercialize new fermentation technologies. The goal of this Phase II project is to develop and implement a set of molecular biology tools designed for acid-tolerant yeast, and working to apply them toward improving small molecule production. Specifically, the molecular biology tools are useful for tuning (up- or down-regulation) user-defined gene transcription and translation. Engineered microbes harboring the desired genetic modification(s) are assayed for improved small molecule production from sugar in small scale fermentations. Successful genetic modifications are those that result in more efficient small molecule product formation from sugar, and ideally decreased biomass formation from sugar, providing a lower production cost in a scaled, commercial process.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research Phase II project is the sustainable production of high-value lipids (oils,
    waxes and fatty acids) from abundant and inexpensive feedstocks. The process is
    based on a unique lipid- accumulating microorganism found in Yellowstone National
    Park that is capable of directly converting a wide range of feedstocks such as
    wheat straw, corn stover, and industrial by-products (e.g. molasses, glycerol)
    to valuable lipid products such as Omega-7 fatty acids and high-melting temperature
    waxes. Renewable oils, waxes and fatty acids have significant demand in a wide
    range of industries (e.g. neutraceuticals, biolubricants, cosmetics, candles and
    soaps). Consumers will clearly benefit from this technology through the reduction
    of our dependence on petroleum-based products while generating a market for agricultural
    wastes and by-products. Since few companies and research groups are investigating
    fungal lipid production directly from lignocellulosic biomass for higher- value
    products, both industry and the scientific community will benefit from the knowledge
    gained by this research. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
    project describes a simple, novel and cost-effective process for converting lignocellulosic
    and other waste feedstocks to high- value lipids using a microorganism isolated
    from Yellowstone National Park, which is capable of withstanding extreme acidic
    conditions and producing powerful enzymes for degrading cellulose, lignin and
    hemicellulose. The organism accumulates high concentrations of valuable lipids
    in a cost-effective ?one-step? process. The produced lipids based on renewable
    resources creates a market for waste agricultural materials. The primary objective
    of this SBIR project is to further develop the process for commercial production
    of lipid products from waste organic feedstocks. Phase II efforts will focus on
    optimizing the process with a bench pilot-scale system, performing process flow
    design and techno-economic analysis of commercial production systems, analyzing
    lipid products in detail, and targeting appropriate markets/customers for the
    produced lipid products. Coming out of the Phase II program, the goal is to have
    a pilot- level demonstration system designed to produce economically viable yields
    of high-value lipids from a variety of substrates for defined target markets and
    customers."

    purity of a sample of the surfactant.  During Phase II, synthetic biology methods
    will be used to increase the efficiency of the microorganism producing the surfactant.
    \ In addition, multiple samples of purified surfactant will be shipped to customers

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop a novel engineered microbiome as a potential therapeutic for a rare skin disease called Netherton syndrome. Netherton syndrome (NS) is a rare, severe skin disease with high mortality and few treatment options. This proposal aims to develop a new therapeutic for this disease, a microbe-based protein delivery system of LEKTI, the missing protein responsible for NS symptoms. At the end of this project, a candidate live biotherapeutic product candidate (LETKI-secreting strain of S. epidermidis) will be nominated and the Company will have sufficient data with which to proceed into formal preclinical studies and subsequent human testing. This proposed product will have the potential to address thousands of patients in the U.S., and the broader proof-of-principle of this microbe-based technology offers significant potential to treat millions of patients living with skin conditions. This offers significant advances in innovation in addition to broad commercial potential.

    This project aims to develop a novel therapeutic candidate composed of an engineered strain of S. epidermidis that secretes LEKTI protein to the skin for the treatment of Netherton syndrome (NS). NS is a rare but severe autosomal recessive disease that affects the skin, hair, and immune system. NS is caused by mutations in in the SPINK5 gene encoding the serine protease inhibitor lymphoepithelial Kazal-type related inhibitor (LEKTI), which contains 15 serine protease inhibitory domains. The goal of this Phase II project is to demonstrate a proof-of-concept therapeutic for NS: an engineered commensal microbe that delivers discrete domains of LETKI to the skin. The proposed Phase II research plan will establish critical criteria for nominating a potential live biotherapeutic product (LBP) candidate composed LEKTI-secreting S. epidermidis. This research will perform key activities in preclinical development of an LBP: identify an optimal sequence of LEKTI; develop analytical methods for detecting LEKTI secreted from an engineered strain of S. epidermidis; and develop analytical methods for measuring biodistribution and adsorption of LEKTI secreted by S. epidermidis in a human in vitro model.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project touches upon everything from shower doors to
    consumer electronics to window glass. Deposition of high-quality thin films on
    a large scale with precise energy control can allow, for one example, diamond-like
    carbon (DLC) on glass.  DLC coatings on glass can prevent soapy film build-up

    Control of the deposition's energy flux has been shown in laboratory demonstrations
    to be required for many thin films including diamond-like carbon, transparent

    for scale and usability; process development for specific commercial applications.
    The company will deliver a fully integrated control system and a source, scaled
    by 2x and designed for manufacture. Process development will consider beam energetics
    and geometry of beam/target/substrate relative to film and substrate properties.
    For DLC, this will focus on tribological and optical properties. For silver, they
    will test for continuity of ultra-thin films. Transparent Conducting Oxide (TCO)
    efforts will focus on electrical properties and substrate impacts, particularly
    carrier lifetime in silicon.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a drug discovery platform that will identify novel types of antibody therapeutics.  The goal is to use antibodies to increase or decrease the activity of a type of cell signaling receptor called "G protein-coupled receptors" (GPCRs). There are more than 400 non-olfactory human GPCRs that are involved in all aspects of health and disease, including cancers, autoimmune diseases, pain, inflammation, and others. About 25% of GPCRs have been targeted by approved small molecule drugs, but efforts for the remaining have often failed because of the inability of small molecules to distinguish between similar GPCRs. Antibody drugs can overcome this hurdle because of their much higher specificity for their targets. This project will bring to commercialization the first technology that directly identifies antibodies that modulate GPCR function. These antibodies will impact healthcare by enabling therapies for diseases with poor or no current treatments. They also will impact scientific understanding by enabling the study of GPCR-related physiology and disease. The commercial impacts are potentially very large. The GPCR drug market is over $100B, and most antibody therapeutics have annual sales over $1B. The platform described here could enable dozens of novel GPCR antibody therapeutics, creating value for patients, society, and co-development partners.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project is to develop a drug discovery technology for discovering antibodies that modulate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Current methods are limited because GPCR antigens are often not properly folded, and because antibodies are selected by how tightly they bind GPCRs, rather than by the effect they exert. Those that bind typically do not have any effect at all. This project will build on the successful proof-of-concept from Phase I that demonstrated the platform's ability to identify directly functional antibody agonists for a human GPCR. The proposal addresses the four main technical requirements that pharmaceutical customers cite as important: Ability to work on many types of GPCRs, ability to isolate antibodies with varied modulating effects, use of a highly diverse, high-quality scFv library, and a workflow that can quickly isolate, optimize and characterize dozens of candidates. The goals of this project are to improve how the platform's yeasts express GPCRs and functionally couple them to different selectable readouts, construct a proprietary scFv library, and optimize the workflow by incorporating sequencing bioinformatics and antibody characterization, including flow cytometric analysis of cell-binding and functional assays on cultured mammalian cells.

  title: 'SBIR Phase II:  A platform for identifying antibodies that modulate human
    membrane receptors involved in disease'
- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase II project will create a material, printer, and software
    system for printing a novel set of flexible, durable materials for additive manufacturing
    technologies. Additive manufacturing, or 3D Printing, is a rapidly growing $7bn
    industry, which enables small and medium enterprises to competitively manufacture
    new and innovative products. It is a key to strengthening the US manufacturing
    economy. Continued growth and health of the 3D printing industry, particularly
    for manufacture of functional parts for finished goods, will depend upon an expansion
    of the available material library. 3D printing materials are limited to a small
    segment of the plastics in common industrial use today. This project will expand
    that material library with development of printable polyurethane elastomers with
    a broad range of flexibilities. These materials will be particularly relevant
    for markets that demand personalization and customization, such as patient-specific
    medical devices, sporting goods, and footwear. Manufacturers of flexible, durable
    polyurethane goods for industrial and automotive products will also benefit from
    low cost small-scale production of parts made from materials with performance
    that match their product specifications. The printing system will enable production
    of parts with user-specified geometry and flexibility, and will also enable multi-material
    printing for novel product designs. \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project will produce
    a set of reactive polyurethane precursor formulas which can be combined to form
    printable, flexible polyurethanes with a broad hardness range. The Phase II project
    will also produce an integrated system of printer control software and printhead
    design for production of parts with the polyurethane precursor formulas. The materials
    will be printed using extrusion 3D printing techniques, and customized to handle
    liquid, reactive feeds. The research approach will include determination of the
    starting materials to control reaction rates, rheology development, and part solidification.
    Software development will incorporate printing parameters for the spectrum of
    materials that can be produced from the starting materials in order to produce
    a user interface where part flexibility is specified as a function of part geometry,
    and the printer receives commands for printing the desired object.  The material
    \ will be parameterized to determine space-filling properties of the material
    as a function of composition, print speed, and printhead geometry.  This 3D printing
    technology will overcome challenges in part durability and printing speeds that
    are common to photo-cure approaches to produce flexible parts, and will greatly
    extend the part durability and flexibility available to extrusion 3D printing.\n\nThis
    award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
    criteria."

    Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is to make significant contributions to the future

    the thermally-underserved of America's workforce (who are disproportionately female

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be a user-friendly and scalable infection control surveillance software platform using advanced biotech and data analytics for monitoring hospital-acquired infection. There is a significant clinical problem in hospitals, where 1 in 25 people who check in will develop a hospital acquired infection. Currently, hospital infection control practitioners (ICPs) have few analytical tools to identify the source of these infections, which can be deadly and cost the health care industry an estimate of $45 billion year. The innovation under development harnesses advanced epidemiological approaches in an easy-to-use application that will enable ICPs to use bacterial genetics as a means to monitor infectious spread within their system so that their sources can be eliminated.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II proposal is to develop an infection control surveillance software system using whole-genome sequencing of pathogens and advanced data analytics.  The innovation addresses the critical lack of accessible genetic analysis applications designed for local infection control surveillance. Hospitals are observing ever increasing rates of antibiotic resistant infections. These are expensive, endanger patients, and are becoming harder to trace as medical care becomes more complex and spread over multiple facilities. Unfortunately, ICPs have few new tools, other than best hygiene practices, to reduce their mounting infection rates. Decades of research has revealed that epidemiological surveillance using genetic analysis provides a robust level of pathogen traceability; however, this knowledge has not been transferred into hospitals where it is critically needed, due to a lack of technical infrastructure and analytical accessibility. In this Phase II project, the goal is to complete the development of a software application that will enable ICPs to easily and accurately process bacterial genetic data in their own offices and generate rich, meaningful and easy to interpret reports concerning bacterial spread in their networks. ICPs will be warned when infection sources relate to each other, suggesting that a deeper investigation is needed. The result is that infection sources, which are currently missed, will be proactively identified and targeted.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will provide commercial validation at scale of feedback-based control of arc behavior within the vacuum arc remelting (VAR) process.  This will improve VAR performance in the production of specialty metals, resulting in improvements to ingot quality while reducing electricity consumption.  Specialty metals, such as titanium and nickel alloys, are used in critical high-performance parts in industries such as aerospace, energy, and medicine, where the failure of these parts may lead to catastrophic systems failures and potentially life-threatening situations. In a VAR furnace, extreme temperature gradients from constricted and/or diffuse arcs sustained between the melting electrode and ingot can cause non-homogeneous material and inclusion defects, resulting in up to 8% yield loss per ingot, representing $1.024 billion in losses across the domestic industry.  Improved control over the arc distributions during the melting of these metals is expected to decrease the frequency of defects in the final product and increase overall yield from the process. The proposed project is expected to reduce these loses by up to 50% through the application of active, feedback control of the arc dynamics. This type of control is expected to increase yield, decrease energy requirements, and increase safety of the manufacturing process industry-wide.

    This project will result in a system capable of detecting and manipulating the distribution of the arcs utilized during VAR processing. The Phase I effort showed that it is possible to simultaneously detect arc locations on the electrode and influence their movements, using electromagnetic coils, in real time. In Phase II, the arc measurements will be coupled through feedback to control the arc distribution in an industrial-scale research VAR, providing proof of concept at industrial scale. In so doing, the optimal electromagnetic coil geometry, hardware, and materials for driving the arc motion at scale will be identified and constructed. A series of industrial experiments are planned to validate the control system. The chemical composition of the ingots produced during controlled and uncontrolled conditions will be characterized to correlate defects with observed arc behaviors and to identify optimal control parameters.  Similarly, the measured arc distributions will be used to validate the computational solidification modeling, which will be used to identify probable defect regions. The combination of experimental data and validated simulation results will be used to inform the VAR feedback control system regarding optimal arc distribution, yielding an improved control strategy for tailoring the melt process and improving ingot quality.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project are foundations for an emerging industry: insects in agriculture.
    \ Beta Hatch is pioneering the production of new animal feed ingredients, developing
    technology to mass produce insects, and creating STEM jobs. The proposed work
    will allow scaling insects as a sustainable protein-rich feed ingredient. With
    predictable year-round production, this will contribute to a more robust and secure
    agricultural system. The Beta Hatch insect ranch, which will be designed through
    integration of the results from this project, is an on-site solution to convert
    organic by- products into valuable feed ingredients and fertilizer. These ranches
    are being designed as conversions of underutilized spaces (warehouses and poultry
    barns), to bring jobs to rural and HUBZone areas. We work closely with farmers,
    our main customers, to establish the performance and economic value of our products.
    Insects provide nutrition and make animals healthier. Our frass (insect manure),
    is an organic fertilizer that stimulates healthy soils, and has no nitrates (no
    runoff). The proposed work will allow us to establish insects as the world?s most
    sustainable animal feed ingredient, and to disrupt the $400B animal feed market.
    \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project proposes to cost effectively scale insect production
    for agricultural markets. Of the millions of insect species that exist, only a
    handful have been successfully reared under controlled conditions and even fewer
    have been mass produced. And yet insects have the potential to fill essential
    roles in agricultural supply chains by biodegrading wastes, removing or recycling
    toxins, and providing nutrition for animals. In order to meet the scale, quality
    and cost requirements for agricultural markets, significant R&D must solve some
    core challenges in insect mass production. We propose to integrate biological
    and engineering approaches to develop novel oviposition substrates, identify and
    mitigate causes of mortality, design automated and flexible diet handling systems,
    optimize rearing trays (the basic unit of production), and maximize yields with
    automated water and diet delivery. The proposed work will cut over 80% of our
    costs, produce several patents, and inform the design of a scalable insect ranching
    facility. As a natural part of animal diets, insects are a predictable protein-rich
    alternative feed ingredient, with year-round controlled production. In Phase 1
    of this project, we established an insect breeding program, explored novel inorganic
    diets, and identified the core production challenges for scaling insects-as-feed.
    For this NSF SBIR Phase 2 project, we develop solutions that will reduce the cost
    of production and control the cost of future facilities.\n\nThis award reflects
    NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation

    innovative method of fabrication explores and exploits the ultimate capability
    of atomic layer deposition (ALD) for achieving nanometer-scale smoothness in very
    thick, multilayer films. Unlike related methods that rely on deposition onto wires
    and slicing, this method uses ALD to deposit sequences of low and high refractive
    index materials onto batch-fabricated cylindrical silicon precursors, with well-controlled
    layer thicknesses varying from a few nanometers to tens of nanometers. Subsequently,
    polishing the wafer will yield membranes with hundreds of high-value focusing
    devices on a single wafer, minimizing the processing costs per device. Second,
    the envisioned wafer-level processing method allows for a necessary tilt control
    of the precursors, not possible with wires, for better focusing properties. Third,
    the method is extendable towards depositing sequences of more-than-two material
    layers, which enables the fabrication of step-wise graded index diffractive devices
    with single foci and featuring ultimate diffraction efficiency. Phase I qualified
    the individual key processes and proved their integration capability into a complete
    fabrication sequence, while Phase II will deal with the fabrication and testing
    of prototypes and preparation for production, using long runs of atomic layer
    deposition processes, as is necessary for functional devices.\n\nThis award reflects

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate an additive manufacturing process to produce 3-D woven textile products at scale. Presently, the clothing manufacturing industry still relies on manual sewing machines that were invented over one-hundred and seventy years ago. This system limits the manufacturing process and textile capability; an abundance of steps leads to waste, inefficiencies, and segmented products. Further, due to the low cost of foreign labor, the US textile industry has effectively come to a halt: 97.3 percent of all clothing sold in the United States in 2015 was imported. This project seeks to develop a novel method for manufacturing woven textile products by employing additive manufacturing methodologies to automate the production process, while simultaneously enabling complete customization and on-demand production. This technology will enable premium and competitive textile manufacturing to return from overseas, creating high value-added jobs and a designer community in the United States while also generating tax revenue. In the same way that 3-D printing technology has revolutionized the hard goods manufacturing process, this project seeks to create an entire new industry of additively manufactured textile products, enabling significant opportunities for future innovation.

    This project develops a novel technology to manufacture near-net-shape three dimensional woven textile products. To develop this technology, this project first proved feasibility through creating constituent textile panels of non-standard shapes with 3-D topography in Phase I, laying the foundation for continued development into fully three-dimensional, seamless, finished products produced in-situ through Phase II. By additively producing garments from a unique 3-D model complete customization to each individual consumer is possible on a large scale, though this has never before been accomplished. Further, through the on-demand production of clothing customized to individual consumers, the need for substantial inventory buildup is eliminated. In this way, additively manufactured textile products are both more desirable to consumers and more economical to producers. As such, the societal and environmental benefits of automated and on-demand textile manufacturing within the United States are significant, including eliminating massive amounts of waste from typical cut-and-sew manufacturing techniques, revamping a struggling American manufacturing industry, and minimizing the economical, environmental, and geopolitical implications of the United States? current dependence on a convoluted global supply chain.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on the development of a lithium metal battery using a novel Liquefied Gas Electrolyte. While there is an intense global effort to advance electrolyte chemistry for next-generation lithium batteries, these efforts focus almost entirely on liquid and solid-state electrolytes. In contrast, this project aims to further develop the use of a novel class of electrolytes which use solvents that are typically gaseous at room temperature and liquefied under moderate pressures. Phase I work demonstrated world-record cycling lithium metal with an average plating/stripping coulombic efficiency of >99.5% over 400 cycles with (0.5 mA/cm2 and 0.5 mAh/cm2 each cycle) with smooth and highly dense lithium deposition as observed through cryogenic focused-ion-beam characterization. Further, a world-record low temperature electrolytic conductivity of 3 mS/cm at -80 ?C for lithium-based electrolytes was obtained, far exceeding the state-of-art. Lastly, a reversible high temperature shut-down at +40 ?C, due to a decrease in electrolyte conductivity from salt precipitation, was demonstrated. This high temperature shut-down essentially eliminates thermal runaway reaction from occurring, making for a significantly safer battery.

    Further development of these electrolytes through this NSF Phase II grant will enable further work to increase battery specific energy to 450 Wh/kg, expand operating temperatures from -60 to +60 ?C, and increased safety with no thermal runaway while maintaining power and cycle life comparable to conventional Li-ion. This will be accomplished with further development of the electrolyte chemistry to improve lithium metal coulombic efficiency to >99.8% over 1000 cycles, increase the high temperature shut-down to +60~70 ?C, increasing cathode performance to higher voltages and cycle life, and the development of a high throughput R&D line which will offer high precision addition of electrolyte components to fine tune the chemistry. Because the electrolyte chemistry may use several common materials and manufacturing methods, there should be low cost barrier to entry and it is expected there will be significant cost reduction in volume production down to the goal of $100/kWh. The developed technology will be especially well suited for low temperature applications such as high-atmosphere, defense, and aerospace which frequently endure extreme temperatures and require high specific energy. Because of the superior performance at low temperatures compared to the incumbent, South 8 Technologies will first focus on developing the technology in these areas. As the technology matures, an eventual move into grid storage and transportation markets will follow, leading to a substantial decrease in emissions and reliance on imported fuels. The underlying fundamental chemistry with these new materials is a relatively new field and may potentially lead to significant advances in next-generation energy storage devices and broader technologies, leading to new industries, job growth and beyond.

    This SBIR Phase II project, the Engineering Design Instruction Software for implementing Objectives of Next generation standards (EDISON), will combine Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) concepts together with engineering design, simulation, Augmented Reality (AR), 3-D printing, and real-world experiments. The project will create a collaborative platform for middle school engineering projects where students create, analyze, simulate, and construct designs for several types of projects like bridges, cars, circuits, simple machines, drones, and robots. This project will provide positive experiences with STEM and engineering in middle school, when many students lose interest in these economically vital fields. EDISON will foster STEM engagement and inquiry in middle school, by leveraging gaming, team collaboration, 3D printing, and augmented reality. The project will create engineering experiences that connect math and science content directly to real world applications to improve student academic performance in traditional science and math subjects. This work has the potential to promote effective integration of engineering in K-12, prepare students for future careers, expand scientific literacy, and engage diverse groups of students in STEM, supporting NSF's mission.


    This SBIR Phase II project will produce a collaborative engineering design platform for middle school, containing realistic design tools, content creation, embedded standards-based STEM assessment, and tools supporting prototyping and testing. EDISON provides end to end solutions for team-based engineering in middle schools and maintains engagement through gamification. This project will develop sophisticated tools that are lacking in existing engineering curricula, and support math and science standards alignment using model-based engineering, virtual design collaboration, and embedded tools for student evaluation. In this work the Phase I prototype will be extended by developing reusable design modules for circuit design, simple machines, aerodynamics, and programming. Testing tools using sensors and Augmented Reality will be added for real world data collection and analysis. Numerous modular standards aligned lessons and a content creation interface to facilitate EDISON?s transition to an instructional platform will be created. Finally, in collaboration with our University partner EDISON will be extensively tested and student outcomes evaluated in 6th, 7th, and 8th grade classrooms using a combination of embedded, quantitative, and qualitative methods. The goal is to better meet the STEM instructional needs of educators and students with superior capabilities, engaging experiences, and easy to use tools.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to enable organizations - whether businesses, governments, or non-profits - to make more informed, more data-driven decisions. All organizations must decide how to allocate limited resources and do so in the context of meeting a set of objectives, such as profit, social wellbeing, or health. Modeling as a process and models as artifacts of that process allow decision makers to understand data through the lens of objectives and to then make decisions; data alone, no matter how much, cannot make decisions. As more aspects of the world are instrumented and captured digitally, the breadth and quantity of data will out of necessity require larger, more complex models to be built. Organizations will need a modeling workflow and supporting tools that scale with these demands.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the challenge of many users collaboratively building and maintaining analytical models that are consistent and reproducible while allowing for divergent and convergent change. This project will address the resource management challenges identified in development and the interactivity gaps identified in user testing of the Phase I prototype. The result will be a commercial software application for building models that manages code, data, and the evolution of both over time by many users.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to search and understand documents across domains. It is a powerful tool for consumers and businesses to route, categorize and ensure key points of a document are seen. This makes it easy for overwhelmed users to search, link topic information to knowledge bases and extract customized data, even if they can't think of the right keywords.  Online search can infer the popularity or relevance of a page based on data from millions of users, including a user's location and what they've shown interest in; however, business users don't benefit from these features. Users view concepts in a summary linked to a knowledge base, allowing them to see summaries, triage documents on mobile devices, write rules to sort or filter them automatically, and see key data before ever opening the document.  This Phase II project improves information extraction systems by generating answerboxes from complex documents. Consumers will be able to quickly get the gist of formal documents such as consumer credit contracts, insurance policies, industry solicitations, engineering and other difficult-to-read documents. This innovation advances knowledge discovery, information retrieval methods, information extraction, slot-filling, and knowledge-base population.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project discovers unsupervised and unrestricted slots and fillers (attributes and values) to construct structured summaries based on keywords and underlying patterns in document collections. It extends the state of the art by not requiring a manually crafted catalogue of slots and complements supervised approaches by discovering new slots. While conventional Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches are effective on well-formed sentences, the techniques described here are effective for semi-structured content such as section headers, lists and tables. Additionally, NLP based approaches for fact extraction and text summarization are primarily lexical, requiring further processing for disambiguating and linking to unique entities and concepts in a knowledge base. This approach further advances the state of the art by eliminating these steps as it identifies keywords and links to knowledge base concepts as a first step in the discovery process. This concept-linking enables terms to explicitly map to semantic concepts in other ontologies such that they are available to enable reasoning and understanding.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the creation of a new tool that could prevent the loss of sensitive data stored in big data management systems due to cyber-attacks. Furthermore, the proposed cybersecurity tool can allow organizations to audit their big data usage to prevent data misuse and comply with various privacy regulations. Recent attacks have shown that the leakage/stealing of stored data may result in enormous monetary loss and damage to organizational reputation, and increased identity theft risks for individuals. Furthermore, in the age of big data, protecting the security and privacy of stored data is paramount for maintaining public trust, and getting the full value from the collected data. The company's proposed tool will potentially have significant impact by addressing these important societal needs with respect to big data security and privacy. Based on customer discovery findings, this tool will also address an important customer need found in many different industries and has the potential to have significant commercial impact as more and more companies are adopting big data technologies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will commercialize a novel big data privacy, security and governance management tool that provides efficient data sanitization, attribute-based access control, accountability and governance policy enforcement capabilities for protecting sensitive data stored in big data management systems. In addition, the proposed product will provide novel data sensitivity aware intrusion detection capabilities. The Phase II research objectives are: 1) to develop an efficient attribute-based access control framework to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data; 2) to develop data sanitization capabilities for complying with various regulations; 3) to develop a scalable audit log capture, storage and querying framework for increasing accountability for big data usage; and 4) to develop a data sensitivity aware intrusion detection framework to quickly detect potential attacks against sensitive data. These objectives pose significant research challenges with respect to scaling to big data without impacting the existing workflow of the companies. The company proposes to address these challenges by using novel code injection techniques combined with risk aware audit log generation and data sensitivity aware machine learning based intrusion detection techniques.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project centers on bringing enhanced independence, productivity, and quality of life for hundreds of thousands of individuals in the US who live with severe physical disability due to spinal cord injury or other debilitating neurodegenerative disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Due to improvements in emergency medicine and increasing average age, these individuals represent a growing population that is underserved by current assistive technologies (ATs). The ATs being relied upon to carry out basic tasks are still primitive, offer limited versatility, and fail to meet end-user needs. Meanwhile, computers and internet play ever-growing roles in everyday life and are regarded as equalizers that allow individuals to have similar vocational, recreational, and educational opportunities. The Tongue Drive System (TDS) offers individuals with severe physical disabilities an intuitive and superior mechanism for accessing computer-based resources, wheelchairs, smartphones, smart homes, etc. TDS harnesses the power of the human tongue, which often retains full capability in these individuals despite losses of other functions, to drive human-computer interactions. TDS has the potential to revolutionize the current AT market in the US and around the world with an anticipated market size of $1B within its primary market segment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-II project aims to bring this transformative and game-changing AT to market by continuing the design, development, evaluation, and expansion of a robust, reliable, and real-time TDS ecosystem. In Phase-I, the TDS hardware was redesigned and consolidated so that all signal processing functions were self-contained into a new standalone TDS (sTDS) headset system with a dual-band wireless link that can directly interface with a target peripheral by transmitting formatted user-defined commands. In Phase-II the designs for a solid and intuitive user interface, a smartphone app, and a robust and rugged powered wheelchair interface module to effectively control key target devices will be fine-tuned in the final stages of development in preparation for launch. The sTDS hardware/software/enclosure will also be tested and ready for manufacturing and meet the FDA regulatory requirements towards submission of a 510(k) premarket notification.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will enable Unmanned Aerial Systems
    (UAS or drones) to safely and reliably operate from moving vehicles and moving vessels at sea.
    There is an immediate need for this capability in many industries. In commercial fishing, drones
    will replace manned aircraft for fish-finding operations, radically reducing cost and risk. In maritime
    security, drones will provide surveillance around ships, including locating a ?man-overboard? in
    time to save the person?s life. In the oil and gas industry, drones will provide rapid-response to oil
    spills by mapping the location and extent of the oil slick, limiting the environmental and economic
    damage. In hydrographic surveying, drones will identify and geo-locate navigation aids, at a
    fraction of the time and cost of current survey methods. In commercial shipping, drones will
    inspect and protect shipping vessels while they are underway. In the transport industry, drones
    will delivery packages the ?last mile? from a delivery truck to a customer?s door. In law enforcement
    and border security, drones will operate from moving patrol vehicles while officers remain safe
    and mobile in the vehicle. These applications are currently difficult or impossible, but will become
    radically safer and easier with the proposed technology.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will advance the current state
    of the art in UAS/drone autonomy, to enable reliable drone operations from moving vehicles and
    moving vessels at sea. Shipboard landing is extremely difficult, due to the heaving and rolling of
    the ship deck, potential high winds, and the high precision control required during landing. Current
    drone technology does not facilitate landing on moving platforms; this prevents their use in
    maritime operations, and has become the main barrier to commercialization in this sector. The
    proposed research will develop a vision-aided relative navigation system that combines precise
    air-to-ship observations with onboard sensor measurements to accurately estimate the relative
    state between the drone and the ship. These relative state estimates will be used to dynamically
    route and control the drone safely on to the ship deck. Technical feasibility of this approach has
    been demonstrated during the Phase I project, which included demonstration of the technology
    in a relevant environment. The primary goals of the Phase 2 project are to improve system
    reliability, expand the operational envelope, and productize our system. The plan to achieve these
    goals includes scientific development paired with extensive testing, validation, and demonstration.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a manufacturing platform for opioid
    medicines. Opioids enable physicians to provide compassionate care to patients
    suffering from acute or chronic disease and trauma. The need for opioid analgesics
    is even more salient for surgeons anticipating the post-operative recovery of
    their patients and planning for end-of-life care. However, opioids are highly
    addictive medicines, a property that has been exploited for commercial gain by
    certain players in the pharmaceutical industry. The impact of this project will
    be to deliver a technology that transforms the existing supply chain for opioids
    by removing the need to grow opium poppy as a drug crop. Instead of sourcing poppy
    materials from poppy-growing countries, this new technology will allow for complete
    production of opioids in a secure industrial facility located in the United States
    where federal agencies can provide oversight and regulation. Additionally, investment
    in this technology will enable the development of many more existing and experimental
    medicines derived from plants, including greatly improved opioids with improved
    efficacy and safety, and cardiovascular and chemotherapeutic therapies that will
    extend and enhance human lives.   \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project will develop
    a bioprocess for opioid active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). To date, the
    only commercially-competitive method for manufacturing opioids and related alkaloids
    is to extract these molecules from plants. However, Baker's yeast was recently
    engineered to biosynthesize opioids, which is a technological advance that could
    enable opioid production by fermentation. However, many technical hurdles remain
    in developing a reliable and cost-effective, commercially-viable production system
    based on existing strains. The objective of this Phase II project is to provide
    a complete demonstration and pilot-scale operation of an API bioprocess that is
    ready for industrial scale up. The research employs four approaches: 1) Further
    development of the engineered yeast strains, 2) scale up of fermentation from
    laboratory scale to pilot scale, 3) optimization of downstream recovery and purification,
    and 4) evaluation of the resulting products to establish their validity as drop-in-replacements
    for existing opioid APIs. The outcome will be a process validated at pilot scale
    and ready for technology transfer to a secure industrial facility that will make
    and sell into the opioids API market. This research will replace opium poppies
    with a modern bioprocess that resembles established, standardized pharmaceutical
    industry methods for antibiotic and biologic APIs.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    This SBIR Phase II project addresses low student engagement through a dynamic video delivery environment with a novel, real-time algorithm that adjusts the instructional pathway to each student's readiness level. According to research, the greatest challenge facing teachers is overcoming the fact that between 25-66% of students are disengaged. Adapting instruction to each student's learning background has long been touted as the most effective method to drive student engagement; when instruction is individualized, engagement and outcomes increase dramatically. By calibrating video segments to student readiness, this project delivers appropriately challenging instruction to most effectively sustain engagement. Building on promising results in Phase I, the project aims to improve engagement and outcomes for all Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) students and, most pointedly, impacts English Language Learners (ELL) who often fall behind in STEM classes because instruction is beyond their readiness and in-class support is insufficient. Considering that ELL population is the fastest-growing population of public school students in the United States, this project has a significant potential to drive a STEM proficient workforce. Furthermore, given a strong, pre-existing client base, the project team is well positioned to penetrate the $110 million immediately addressable market. By 2020, the project team expects to be changing how 10% of U.S. middle schoolers absorb STEM instruction, opening a pathway to the adoption of powerful blended classroom techniques that enhance engagement, improve learning, and promote STEM careers.



    The core innovation is a research-founded algorithm to deliver appropriately complex instruction through all video segments. For successful delivery of appropriately complex instructional video segments, the project (1) measures student complexity readiness, (2) maintains a database of video segments categorized by complexity (using factors such as syntactic and lexical complexity), and (3) uniquely unifies that information to identify a real-time next step for that student (which video segment should be shown). The aim is to enhance outcomes by providing each student an appropriately complex instructional pathway forward. With roots in the leading interactive video solution, this project is made possible through access to a large database of tagged and curated videos (hundreds of thousands) and questions (millions) and provides an unprecedented opportunity to develop adaptive instructional pathways for a diverse learning spectrum. For Phase II, the project team's goal is to deploy a fully functioning classroom prototype of a product built around a middle school Physical Science unit and measure impact on engagement and learning. The team will employ stimulated recall interviewing techniques, speak aloud interview protocols, and quantitative usage logs to assess the feasibility of highly-adaptive video instruction to increase student engagement. Evaluation will include both formative components (to gauge implementation and iterative improvement) as well as summative components to assess impact on engagement and learning outcomes in a mixed-methods design including multiple pilot studies with control and experiment groups.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is aimed to develop and commercialize an extendable/retractable telescopic structural wall for flood protection. This technology will enable more resilient infrastructure in flood-prone areas.  Coastal cities and riverine communities are vulnerable to flooding hazards. These population centers tend to be located near bodies of water, and finding the space to accommodate increasing populations, as well as hazard-resilient infrastructure, represents a challenge for city officials and the engineering community in general.  The commercial opportunity of the technology lies on the increasing worldwide need for flood protection. In fact, the World Bank estimates that 50 billion dollars a year will be spent worldwide in measures to mitigate this hazard. In U.S. only, floods are considered one of the costliest and deadliest natural hazards with an estimated 7.9 billion dollars in damages and 82 fatalities per year. This technology, when developed, will provide a paradigm shift for the prefabricated concrete industry. It will also develop and validate new methods for telescopic interconnection of structural elements.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in a unique concept where structural boxes, made out of fiber reinforced concrete, can be deployed telescopically to withstand forces imposed from external sources, and then return to a retracted position. In Phase I, the feasibility of the concept was demonstrated by the ability of specimens to withstand the forces from three flooding scenarios representative of the targeted market sector: riverine, storm-surges and tsunamis. The Phase II project will focus on assessing the technical features of the walls based on lead-off customer sites. These will include the height of the walls, type of soil, and the hazard assessment, among others technical factors. Studies will be conducted on the local and overall structural response of the walls and the functionality of their mechanical components. Analytical and numerical models will be built and validated with tests on specific components and on full-scale models. The full-scale specimens will be subjected to storm-surges, hurricane, tsunami, slow-rising waters, and impacting debris forces. Robust theoretical framework along with analytical and numerical models and design guidelines will be built to reliably scale and replicate the technology for virtually any site where flood protection is needed.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project uses
    a new class of chemosensor films to continuously measure the concentration of
    heavy metals in a flowing stream of industrial wastewater. This will make it possible
    to know the concentration of several heavy metals at any given time so that treatment
    chemicals used to remove those metals can be metered precisely.  Current treatment
    methods typically rely on infrequent sampling of wastewater streams and time-delayed,
    labor-intensive laboratory measurements. Without the ability to measure continuously,
    wastewater treatment is adjusted based on periodic averages and estimated peak
    discharges.  To reduce the risk of regulatory violation, most wastewater treatment
    systems use twice the volume of treatment chemicals than might otherwise be needed.
    \ With the ability to measure metal concentrations continuously and automatically,
    wastewater treatment can be controlled in real time, cutting treatment chemical
    costs, solid waste costs and measurement labor costs by more than 50%.  Continuous
    measurement also reduces the risk of regulatory violations by > 90%, in turn reducing
    the potential costs of remediation and compliance as well as improving environmental
    conditions for the general public.     \n\nThe key outcome of Phase I research
    was the successful development of 15 new chemosensors permanently bound to a substrate,
    each with a unique response to zinc, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, lead, copper,
    iron, magnesium, manganese, mercury, nickel and tin. In Phase II, responses from
    an array of chemosensors will be fully characterized with a prototype instrument
    developed for commercial use in different industrial environments.  With that
    instrument, a mathematical model will be constructed to accurately convert sensor
    responses into scientific units of measure for multiple dissolved metals. The
    lower limit of detection for existing sensors ranges from 5 ppb to 50 ppb.  In
    parallel with analytical modeling work, chemosensor synthesis work continues to
    lower the limit of detection to 1 ppb, extend sensor life beyond 6 months, and
    broaden the portfolio of sensors to improve metal selectivity.  In the future,
    this new class of bonded chemosensors may be extended to determine the concentration
    of phosphates and many other species that are currently sampled occasionally and
    measured with lab instruments.  For applications where continuous measurement
    is important, this unique family of chemosensors offers great potential for real-time
    process control in a variety of industrial applications."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it addresses the bandwidth crisis, the problem of transmitting an exponentially growing amount of data through a fixed amount of increasingly congested spectrum. The bandwidth crisis limits economic growth by constraining communication, and also poses very serious challenges for national defense and disaster response. Making better use of limited spectrum is therefore of high societal and commercial importance. This project will study a new approach, called spiral modulation, for achieving much more spectrally efficient communication than previously thought possible and thereby directly addressing the bandwidth crisis. Commercially, this could facilitate much more rapid data transfer, enhancing existing business applications and enabling new ones. Spiral modulation is applicable to any form of electromagnetic communication, whether wireless or wire-based. It could lead to commercialization across a wide range of communication sectors including but not limited to wireless, mobile internet, unmanned vehicles, automotive, aviation, and Internet of Things. It is a dual use technology with both civilian and defense applications. Ultimately, spiral modulation could become the core technology for the worldwide telecommunications industry.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project applies new mathematics to the problem of encoding information into waveforms for telecommunication. In current digital communication, information is transmitted using symbol waveforms constructed from sinusoids which have constant amplitude over each symbol period. This approach is known to produce a sharp upper bound on the highest spectral efficiency that can be achieved. By instead constructing symbol waveforms from sinusoidal waveforms with continuously-varying amplitude, spiral modulation bypasses the theoretical limitation on spectral efficiency. Building on prior Phase I research, this project will build an end-to-end hardware prototype to establish the implementation path and performance characteristics of spiral modulation. The research will progress in stages from waveform design and spectral efficiency measurement experiments, through end-to-end radio design in software, the hardware prototype development and documentation of best practices. It is anticipated that this research will show significant spectral efficiency advantages over existing signal modulation techniques. Other possible advantages for spiral modulation may also appear, such as greater tolerance for interference and phase distortion.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project relates to the
    development of non-pharmacological interventions capable of improving clinical
    outcomes following spinal fusion surgery. Between 1998 and 2008, the annual
    number of spinal fusion surgeries increased 137% from 174,223 to 413,171 and the
    national bill for spinal fusion increased 7.9-fold. The greatest risk in spinal fusion
    procedures is failure to fuse, which can be particularly troublesome in high risk
    patients. Failure to fuse leads to poor surgical outcomes for patients and may result in
    chronic pain, secondary surgical procedures, reduced productivity, and/or permanent
    disability. In addition, failure to fuse results in greater clinical burden for physicians
    and increased cost per patient for payers. Lumbar fusions, in particular, have a
    cumulative reoperation rate of 19% over the 11 years following the initial procedure
    (BCC Research, 2010). The present project could result in the identification of new
    surgical devices and techniques capable of improving surgical outcomes, reducing
    complications, and eliminating costs associated with unsuccessful surgery. Osteogenic
    surgical device and techniques developed in the present project may also be used to
    accelerate bone healing and improve clinical outcomes following fractures of the skull,
    face, and long bones.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is to
    demonstrate in an animal model that osteogenic spinal instrumentation accelerates
    new bone formation and improves the rate of posterolateral fusion compared to
    clinically-accepted best practices in spinal fusion surgery. Innovative osteogenic spinal
    instrumentation (pedicle screws, rods, etc.) facilitates both mechanical stabilization of
    the spine and focused delivery of fusion-stimulating direct electric current (DC) at the
    fusion site. Application of therapeutic stimuli via selectively anodized pedicle screws
    accelerates the rate at which new bone is formed in critical regions of the spine such
    as the zygapophyseal joint and lateral gutter. The propensity of newly formed bone to
    create a robust, biomechanically sound fusion of adjacent vertebrae is also increased
    under osteogenic stimulation. Phase I results demonstrate that selectively-anodized
    electroactive pedicle screws effectively deliver focused osteogenic stimuli to key
    regions of the lumbar spine critical to spinal fusion. Results provide computational
    evidence for the technological and clinical success of novel osteogenic
    instrumentation in spinal fusion surgery. Phase II will confirm that the system of
    electroactive spinal instrumentation has the potential to accelerate bone growth and
    improve post-surgical fusion outcomes compared to gold-standard interventions
    utilizing a clinically relevant large animal model.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project stems from addressing the problem of embedded energy in the manufacture of magnesium metal for use in vehicle light-weighting. Improving fuel economy by incorporation of the lightest structural metal, magnesium, does not save on total lifecycle energy consumed if the magnesium was produced using conventional methods. The most energy efficient and economical production method is known is a process technology that was commercially viable during World War II but not at any other time in history. The project innovation reinvestigates and reinvents this dated process, discovering the reasons for technical and economic failure. Domestic magnesium production using state-of-the-art energy-efficient practices will lead to opportunity and growth for downstream manufacturers that support a wide range of military, industrial, and consumer products such as car parts, electronic devices, titanium and steel production, and canned beverages. The economic and environmental benefits of the innovation in the long term will be ever more prescient given the unprecedented rise in use of magnesium metal over the past 100 years. This innovation creates a clean and economic route to magnesium production, helping to reinvigorate light metals industries within the U.S.

    The intellectual merit of this project is derived from a new paradigm in the condensation of magnesium metal gas produced by carbothermal reduction of magnesium oxide. Previously, shock cooling through a meta-stable temperature range was employed, generating pyrophoric powders that are dangerous and difficult to handle. This Phase II research uses both rapid cooling and controlled heterogeneous condensation for the formation of robust, oxidation resistance magnesium condensate. This process is executed in a novel and continuous condenser for high metal throughput. This effort is also made possible through the development of a reduction reactor technology that operates under milder conditions than previously used while maintaining high production rates. Total plant energy consumption will be at least 50% less than the dominant incumbent process. The Phase II project will result in a scaled ore-to-ingot pilot facility for the manufacture of magnesium metal as a raw material into manufacturing processes. Product quality, process feasibility, and proven scale-up will be demonstrated.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project stems from technology for automatic network configuration analysis.  As ever more devices connect to the Internet and rich services move to the "cloud," both the complexity of computer networks and their reliability requirements are rapidly escalating. It is no wonder that network outages and security breaches are common.  Yet another side effect of this complexity, which does not make the headlines but is equally damaging, is that network engineers are understandably fearful of making configuration changes, so networks are unable to evolve at a speed that keeps up with changing business needs.  The technology developed in this project will enable network engineers to validate correctness, security, and performance properties of their networks proactively, before errors reach the running network.  This technology has the potential to improve the robustness of critical network infrastructure that is widely relied upon, to prevent unauthorized access to resources, and to increase the pace of innovation.  The project will also provide insights into the largest "pain points" in modern networks and develop design and analysis techniques to address them.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project further develops the Batfish network configuration analysis technology.  Interactions with pilot customers as well as many interviews with potential customers identified the needs of the marketplace and how the Batfish technology can best be adapted to meet those needs. As a result, the specific goal of this project is to seamlessly aid network engineers in validating network behavior during the policy design phase. Drawing inspiration from how software is developed today, the company will extend Batfish to support continuous integration of network configurations and develop a series of analyses that can find errors in network configurations with minimal input from the network engineers. The anticipated outcome of these research thrusts is a technology that allows network engineers to easily understand and gain confidence in their proposed network designs and to iterate these designs more quickly.   The project will be driven by continued interactions with several pilot customers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the healthcare needs of the 27 million Americans and 300 million patients globally suffering with type 2 diabetes (T2D). These patients are desperate for a safe treatment that reestablishes glycemic control to augment or replace current management strategies such as metformin and insulin, which only slow the progression of the disease. This proposal provides a unique approach to T2D based on an orally delivered intestinal coating that mimics the beneficial metabolic effects of bariatric surgery. The potential commercial impact of this novel treatment is highly significant as the total estimated cost of diabetes management in the US is upwards of $245 billion, and rising. Overall, an astounding 1 in 5 US health care dollars is used for the care of people with diabetes. Therefore, major insurers are very interested in the reimbursement of alternative approaches for treating T2D, thereby lessening the national cost burden.

    The proposed project supports the further development of an entirely novel treatment for T2D based on new insights from bariatric surgery. The medical community has recently recognized that certain bariatric procedures involving duodenal exclusion confer profound and immediate benefits in glucose tolerance. Sleeve-type medical devices have provided clinical validation for this approach, but such devices are invasive and not currently approved due to safety issues. The investigators propose a non-invasive and safe orally-delivered intestinal coating which is expected to provide the same effect as surgery and implanted sleeves, but requires neither a specialist nor sedation. This proposal describes in-vitro and in-vivo experiments that build on positive results of the Phase I project, and drive the company towards human clinical trials. Specific Aim-1 is to optimize the active lead compound through evaluation of a limited number of rational structural variations. Specific Aim 2 is to demonstrate the dose-dependent efficacy and safety of lead formulations in a chronic diabetic animal model. Consultation with leading endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, and material scientists has guided the selection of the materials and methods of this proposal. Completion of the studies outlined in the NSF SBIR Phase II proposal will accelerate clinical translation, bringing this novel treatment closer to patients in need.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of the Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II is to reduce the patient harm and financial burden created
    by the intensifying problem of emergency department (ED) crowding.  ED crowding
    is a threat to patient safety for high acuity patients and has been associated
    with avoidable morbidity and mortality across many conditions.  Concurrently,
    EDs are challenged to efficiently manage large volumes of low-acuity patients
    visiting with non-emergency conditions. The proposed electronic health record
    (EHR) integrated technology deploys novel machine learning algorithms that predict
    clinical events at actionable time-points in patients care pathways.  Characterizing
    the ED as a flow system, these decision support tools will concentrate on the
    root causes that exist at ED inflow and hospital outflow. This new foresight is
    expected to enable innovative hospital operational models that expedite patient
    progression (minimize patient waiting), improve patient safety, and directly translate
    to measurable cost-savings and/or revenue generation. The SBIR Phase II project
    should result in higher yield and scalable decision support technology while promoting
    the value of data-enabled science and engineering in healthcare. \n\n \n\nThe
    proposed project objective is to greatly reduce ED crowding by advancing the data-science,
    decision-science, and operations research that underpins our decision support
    technology. This new technology is based upon a novel combination of data normalization,
    feature selection, and supervised machine learning methods to predict clinical
    events that drives clear action to optimize hospital resources.  This includes
    a decision support tool that functions at ED triage (inflow) to predict risk of
    critical events to empower safe separation of service streams for acutely ill
    and non-urgent patients. A complementary tool functions near hospital discharge
    (outflow) to predict expected discharge time enabling hospital-wide prioritization
    of resources required to expedite discharge. This unlocks downstream capacity
    and removes a major ED outflow bottleneck that creates prolonged waiting. The
    proposed technology is innovative by design to be scaled, yet adaptive to hospitals
    individual patient populations, operational objectives, and risk tolerances. The
    technology is expected to further advance learning with providers about how to
    consume new predictive and explanatory information for decision support.  The
    specific Phase II objectives are to continue the development of the technology
    by: (1) integrating feedback into prediction output, (2) developing performance
    monitoring capabilities, and (3) driving systems-based management of patient progression."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project stems from a potential reduction in the capital cost of wind turbines by an astounding 15x. The Company's patented, remarkably simple design also reduces transportation, maintenance, and land costs, and provides greater location and altitude flexibility. It uses the same aerodynamics as today's dominant wind technology, the horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT), but with innovations that build on recent research into airborne wind energy generation. Multiple, 6-meter airfoils (they look like model airplanes) behave exactly like the outer tips of a conventional wind turbine blade, which is where most of the power is generated in a HAWT. The airfoils run along a rail- as if one captured kites and put them on short leashes - and a linear generator makes the power. The proposed research is a continuation of SBIR Phase I research and development that had demonstrated that these principles are scientifically sound. If successful, this Phase II project would drastically reduce the cost of wind-generated electricity, making it competitive with fossil fuels. It would thus be a completely self-sustaining commercially viable entity, creating jobs and generating tax revenues. By out-competing fossil fuels, it would use market forces to encourage renewable energy development, thus reducing energy-related emissions and improving national health, prosperity, and welfare. The project's light weight, low profile, and easy, flexible set-up may also have military and emergency applications that would help secure the national defense.



    The proposed technology captures energy through translational rather than rotational motion in the tips of the airfoils as they run along a rail tethered by bridles. Its major innovation is a patented bridling system that handles downwind forces (aerodynamic tip-over forces), which are the primary cause of the HAWT's mass and cost. Another major innovation is to run airfoils in an oval rather than a circle. This alters the math behind swept area, the key input for generation capacity. Because the oval's swept area is a function of length and height, rather than radius squared, this project can add capacity in many different ways, escaping the tyranny of building ever-bigger and -taller circles. The first objective is to design, test, build, measure, and refine a 100 kilowatt (kW) device. A meaningful-scale second-generation device will demonstrate the project's ability to meet performance, weight, and cost targets, while facilitating decisions about how to build far larger devices, and modeling their costs. The methods and approaches will continue to conquer challenges in five subsystems: structures, aerodynamics, power generation, control, and grid integration. The team, which includes leading experts in both academia and industry, will design subsystem options. It will convene to find the best system-wide design and construct the device, with many refinements along the way.

    The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer and Research (STTR) project is a method to control invasive or otherwise unwanted trees and shrubs in an ecologically friendly manner with a biodegradable product. This will reduce the quantity of synthetic herbicides and/or synthetic herbicide adjuvants currently applied to control woody plants. This is especially needed near waterways where vegetation managers must choose between expensive mechanical removal or potential harm to sensitive ecosystems. Homeowners, landscapers, farmers, conservationists, utilities, and other customers will have a new product to control invasive trees and shrubs consistent with a mission to be good stewards of the environment.

    This STTR Phase II project proposes to follow initial successful Phase I demonstrations of an enzymatic bio-herbicide or herbicide adjuvant following the principles of termite biomimicry. The objectives of this Phase II project are to identify the mode-of-action, develop high- and medium-throughput bioassays in vitro and in planta, optimize the product formulation, and demonstrate efficacy on various invasive species in the field such as bush honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii), tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima), glossy buckthorn (Frangula alnus), bamboo (Phyllostachys aurea), and potentially others.

    This allows manufacturers to consume eco-friendly product while avoiding major
    field failures and resulting consequences. This new technology would be potential
    replacement for existing ENIG (with market value roughly about 2-3 billion USD/year).
    \n\nThe primary focus of the project is to eliminate black-pad related failures
    and lead to robust, high quality and reliable solder joints for electronic assemblies.
    The root cause of black-pad defects has been identified as hyper corrosion activity
    at gold and nickel-phosphorous interface which involves nickel depletion and an
    enrichment of phosphorous in localized areas. During Phase I, interfacial engineering
    approach had been used to successfully eliminate black pads by achieving marked
    improvement in corrosion resistance. This has led to robust solder joints and
    elimination of brittle failures. In Phase II, the focus will be to scale-up development,
    optimize the product/chemistries and carry out further reliability testing. The
    main goal would be the rapid commercialization of novel ENIG into the market.
    This will involve development of the chemistries/process parameters for replenishing
    solution to make it market ready, economical and efficient for customers, further
    chemical testing for quality compliance (shelf life, quality standards, etc.)
    as well as reliability testing. Reliability testing will involve real world scenarios
    and various industry standard based testing including drop and vibration tests
    and solder ball shear and pull tests at extended thermal exposures."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and apply machine learning statistical tools to Internet of Things (IoT) water delivery and water quality sensors. This will enable prediction and preemptive response to water point failures. The resilience of these environmental services is dependent upon credible and continuous indicators of reliability, leveraged by funding agencies to incentivize performance among service providers. In many locations, these service providers are utilities providing access to clean water, safe sanitation, and reliable energy. However, in some rural areas, there remains a significant gap between the intent of service providers and the impacts measured over time. Achieving the SBIR Phase II core objectives will help close the loop on effective and clean water delivery.  IoT sensors and services will address one of the most critical public health gaps by enabling delivery of reliable and safe water.

    IoT solutions for this environment may help address these information asymmetries and enable improved decisions and response. However, given the remote and power constrained environments and the high degree of variability between fixed infrastructure including age, materials, pipe diameters, power quality, rotating equipment vendors (pumps and generators), servicing, and functionality, any IOT solution would have to either be bespoke engineering, or compensate for these site-wise complexities through analytics. Instead, our SBIR II approach is to develop universal, solar powered cellular and satellite IOT hardware for each service type, and addresses site complexities through cloud-based sensor fusion and statistical learning. In this way, we significantly reduce hardware and logistical costs, and provide value to our customers through service delivery analytics. In Phase I, we demonstrated the application of simple sensors and sophisticated machine learning to identify off-nominal service delivery across a cohort of water pumps of various designs. We developed a universal electrical borehole sensor compatible with disparate fixed infrastructure, and we demonstrated solving the problem of heterogeneous customer hardware with a homogeneous sensor platform and adaptive machine learning backend.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will accelerate the adoption of data intensive precision agriculture, increasing yields while decreasing farm inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides. This project removes the software bottleneck (time and labor) in processing large aerial surveys taken by Unmanned Aerial Systems, enabling a cost-effective and timely process to deliver actionable information to farmers. Using frequent high-quality aerial scans, farmers may optimize the use of fertilizers and more finely control the amount of pesticides and herbicides necessary to increase crop yield. Furthermore, farmers mitigate costs and losses by being able to spot problem areas, minimize the spread of plant diseases, and identify issues such as standing water, irrigation malfunctions, and persistent automated machinery errors in planting or cultivation. This project provides special benefit for rural customers having inadequate internet infrastructure by eliminating the need to upload massive imagery to the cloud for processing. The technology is part of a broad initiative in agriculture addressing the need for large increases in food production by 2050 in response to the projected growth of the world?s population to over 9 Billion people.

    This project will continue development of algorithms for on-the-fly orthorectification, stitching, and normalization of aerial image mosaics and their deployment in an easy-to-use software prototype. The Phase I already demonstrated industry-leading speeds for such image processing. The technology behind this research project is designed from the ground up to process massive data with less memory and increased speed relative to other approaches, enabled by a proprietary streaming image representation, that allows multichannel gigapixel and terapixel images to be treated as ordinary images. This Phase II supports new extensions to the software that simplify and accelerate delivering a stitched and analyzed map, such as prioritizing computation in regions of the image that a customer is exploring. This would effectively eliminate the delay between image acquisition on unmanned aerial vehicles and when it can be used. Crop consultants have identified this as a transformative capability, as it enables ground-truthing information derived from aerial imagery in the same field visit, saving time and labor. The performance gains in compute-limited environments supported by this project are a key link between new capabilities to gather information and a farmer?s ability to utilize it to increase productivity while reducing costs.

    to develop precision-guided delivery of drugs or diagnostic compounds to the site
    of damage in traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI is quite common; every year, over
    10 million people worldwide injure their brain, and it is the most common cause
    of death and disability in young people. There are currently no drugs available
    that would limit the additional damage to the brain from swelling and inflammation
    after the injury or help repair the brain. The company's technology allows one
    to guide a drug to the injured brain and keep it there until it has done its job,
    while less of the drug goes to normal tissues. This way, it will be possible to
    use drugs that, while beneficial in brain injury, may do damage elsewhere. It
    also makes it possible to use new types of drugs that would otherwise not reach
    their target in the brain. If the company is successful in bringing this technology
    to the clinic, it may make brain injury victims better, and significant savings
    to the healthcare system may also be obtained. \n\nThe proposed project will develop
    a highly efficacious technology platform for site-specific delivery of drugs to
    acute brain injury. The main reasons for the failure of neuro-protective agents
    in clinical trials are lack of specificity and the dose limiting effects of the
    therapy. Targeted delivery can circumvent this problem. In Phase I, the company
    described a novel peptide, CAQK, which specifically delivers various types of
    payloads to sites of brain injury from systemic administration. Developing improved
    variants of this peptide with high affinity and stability is important in ensuring
    optimal clinical translation of this technology. The objective of this project
    is to optimize the delivery platform by exploring different modifications of the
    CAQK peptide, and to use high throughput screening of chemical compound libraries
    to search for compounds that reproduce the CAQK activity. The outcome of this
    Phase II application will be a panel of stable, long-circulating, high affinity
    peptides and/or small molecule chemical mimetics that can be used for targeted
    drug delivery to injured brain. The most promising compounds will be validated
    in animal models of brain injury. Transformative advances in brain injury treatment
    in the form of increased efficacy, reduced side effects, and ease of administration
    should ensue."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project supports the development of a technology to improve the way drugs are delivered in the body. Less than 2% of the dose of any medication finds its way to the place in the body where it is needed. The other 98% is either eliminated or, even worse, concentrates in areas where they can lead to side effects. This happens with all medications from daily anti-inflammatory drugs to the latest cancer therapies. If successful, this new approach will turn a regular drug into a medicine that is concentrated and activated only at the area where it is needed. This advance should increase the efficacy of the therapy and minimize its side effects. For example, the local drug activation can target chemotherapies to tumors with minimal side effects. Antibiotics could be delivered at higher local doses than is currently possible, eliminating local infections and limiting the creation of drug-resistant bacteria. Anti-inflammatory medications could be more powerful, improving the management of post-operative pain, potentially reducing the use and misuse of opioid drugs. Overall, this technology could reduce the costly burden of adverse drug events, estimated at more than $177 billion.

    To create targeted medicines, researchers rely on the endogenous differences between diseased tissue and the rest of the body (e.g., molecular markers or differences in enzymatic activity). Local drug activation provides a new path to create targeted medicines. The approach starts by injecting a biodegradable polymer at the desired site. The material contains exogenous chemical activators that do not exist anywhere else in the body. Then a drug is given systemically that is inactive until it comes in contact with the gel improving local efficacy and diminishing systemic side effects. Phase 1 results showed that an inactivated chemotherapy eliminated tumors in mice after only 10 days of therapy with minimal side effects. The Phase II project will expand the benefits of the local drug activation platform to other therapies, including cancer therapies and pain medications. The long-term goal is to show the applicability of the approach to multiple classes of drugs and increase their potential to improve outcomes for diseases that affect local areas of the body. If successful, this advance should enable medications for people who are too frail to receive them and enable therapies to work in combinations that were previously impossible due to dose-limiting toxicities.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in reducing the energy consumption from air and gas compression.  In the United States, industrial air compressors consume over 12% of manufacturing electricity consumption, or 399 trillion BTU.  5% of natural gas production in the US is consumed by compression to move the gas to the end-user.  On a global basis, compressors driven by electric motors are estimated to consume 32% of the electricity consumption from electric motor driven systems, or 2,267 terawatt hours per year.  At $0.10 per kilowatt hour, this translates into nearly $227 billion of annual electricity costs for compression. Carnot's technology has the potential to reduce energy consumption from compression by 20% or more across multiple compression applications. By reducing the energy consumed for air and gas compression, the technology will reduce the carbon footprint of industrial and commercial activity in the US and internationally.



    Isothermal compression has been thought unachievable due to the requirement of rapidly capturing the heat of compression. The Phase I project allowed us to integrate proven design elements from prior prototypes, along with a complete liquid recirculation and heat dissipation system, into a single platform. This project will build upon research performed under the Phase I project to bring our compression technology to commercial readiness. A 2-year research and development plan will be executed to address key systems engineering elements of the technology to achieve commercial ready status.  A combination of lab experiments, thermodynamic modeling, design, engineering, and benchtop prototyping will be used to develop a commercial ready system design that can be applied to a broad range of industrial compression applications.  Further study and exploitation of isothermal compression may lead to an ever-evolving field of application, potentially creating additional areas of research and learning.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the challenge of fouling on membranes used in biopharmaceutical processing. The successful application of this coating would enable increase in the membrane lifetime and product yield of various production streams as less of the valuable compounds remain trapped in the membrane. This can increase production capacity for life-saving medicines, reduce production costs and, in certain cases, enable continuous biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Furthermore, functionalization of membranes currently involve significant quantities of environmentally harmful solvents, which may be leachable during usage of the membrane. This issue is avoided in the current project by utilizing initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) process which does not require any solvent. This coating technology can also be extended to other systems including wastewater purification, food & beverage production, industrial separations, and medical devices that rely on a similar functionalization.

    The objective of Phase II will be to demonstrate a commercially viable manufacturing process to produce surface modifications within porous membranes using the iCVD process. Previous work in this subject has focused on top-coats on the top surfaces of reverse osmosis membranes, but the chemistries utilized have never before been demonstrated within interior structures of the membrane filters. During the Phase II work, the performance of the coatings will be optimized by using existing deposition equipment to tune the coating chemistry and process conditions to maximize the flux and throughput by minimizing protein fouling. The other main technical goal of the work will be to translate the current batch process into a continuous roll-to-roll process that is amenable to large-scale manufacturing. The outcome of this study will be a proven coating chemistry that is effective and durable in the membrane application, and an optimized manufacturing process capable of being implemented within current standards of membrane manufacturing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project answers the call that science students go beyond memorizing facts to understand content on a deeper, conceptual level. In chemistry, this goal is particularly difficult to achieve because the underlying concepts describe the behaviors of particles that are not directly observable to students. College instructors are also under added pressure to transform their teaching methods to help ensure student retention and success. In the subject area of organic chemistry, this transformation is even more important, due to the relatively high fail-rate in the course, especially for under-represented minorities and first generation students. The mobile learning tools and data collection platform in this project would help to solve both of these issues with an innovative method for intuitive learning and assessment which helps to make molecules and reactions come alive with game-based mobile applications. The game apps are playable by students of all ages, so the concepts of organic chemistry, as well as other science courses, become familiar and accessible as early as middle school. The broader vision is to open the pipeline for students to progress into STEM careers which have been difficult to reach in the past.

    This project makes the theoretical touchable for organic chemistry students by building mobile game-based learning tools based on mechanisms, a key underlying concept used to teaching the course. This project will produce the Mechanisms suite of game apps, and bring an intuitive, tactile interface to learning chemistry. The research and development of this phase of the project will expand the user interaction model from Phase I to multiple modules of content for students. The data from the mobile learning tools will be synthesized with machine learning techniques to create an adaptive method to ensure the applications provide the appropriate level of challenge to the student learner. Clinical and longitudinal efficacy studies will be part of the research effort as the game modules are developed and released. The data platform will be optimized to integrate with multiple learning management systems and to be readily expandable to subjects beyond organic chemistry. The dashboard of the platform will allow both instructors and students to access the data and inform learning processes to achieve greater comprehension and success in the course. Commercialization will be achieved through direct-to-student downloads, subscriptions of the data platform by institutions, and licensing the technology to courseware providers.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is for the development of scaled processes for the industrial manufacture of end-user moldable advanced composite materials for use in protective athletic equipment. Currently, protective athletic equipment and accessories must be produced using industrial manufacturing techniques that have high tooling costs. As a result, manufacturers produce a small range of predetermined sizes and shapes, which do not provide a custom fit for end users. In the case of athletic gear, there is a growing market for hard-shell protective equipment which can be custom molded for a better fit. Polyimine polymers and advanced composites offer a compelling blend of strength and malleability in order to create more user-friendly lightweight and durable advanced composites that may be shaped by the end-user. In addition to creating greater user customization, both the virgin polyimine polymer, and advanced composites that incorporate polyimines, are intrinsically recyclable in a closed-loop, low-energy, solution-based system. The total U.S. composite materials market is $25 billion, representing 36% of the global composites sector. Polyimine polymers and advanced composite derivatives will reduce environmental waste and increase manufacturing efficiencies across a broad range of vertical markets in the composites sector including personal protective equipment, aerospace, automotive, and infrastructural materials.

    The intellectual merit of this project derives from the development of the unique chemistry of polyimine polymers. Polymers can be broadly grouped into two categories, thermosets and thermoplastics. Thermosets are strong due to the chemical characteristics of the plastic. However, once cured, thermosets cannot be reshaped. As a result, thermosets are neither repairable, nor are they efficiently recyclable. In contrast, thermoplastics, which are weaker than thermosets, may be molded and remolded. However, remolding requires very high temperatures. Polyimine polymers represent a new class of moldable and remoldable thermoset materials. Importantly, these polymers combine high rigidity and tough mechanical properties with mild molding temperatures. This Phase II research project will include scaled processes for the industrial manufacture of end user moldable composite materials that are a maximum of one-quarter inch in thickness and meet industry standards for limb joint protective equipment. The Phase II effort will also include a variety of types of material and mechanical testing, both in-house and at certified laboratories, in addition to extensive efforts at proving out manufacturability, as well as pilot production.

    or administration of suboptimal vaccines. The use of silk fibroin, a low-cost
    biomaterial, represents a novel approach to vaccine stabilization. The goal of
    the proposed research is to advance the silk-stabilization platform towards commercialization
    of vaccines that do not require cold storage. Building upon successful Phase I
    results, advanced formulation optimization studies will define a final product
    formulation for rotavirus that is compatible with scaled manufacturing and achieves
    all storage and in vivo attributes necessary for a commercial product. Through
    process optimization studies, fabrication of a dissolvable thin strip for oral
    delivery of rotavirus will be translated into a scalable manufacturing process
    that provides an attractive alternative to traditional drying methods. Evaluation
    of stabilized rotavirus vaccine films in an improved animal model will enable
    validation of in vivo immunogenicity and offer insight into vaccine stabilization
    and oral film delivery more broadly."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a robust, in-line plasmonic sensor for the detection of mercury in natural gas. Mercury naturally contaminates natural gas at the parts per million levels and can corrode critical aluminum components in processing facilities. Heat exchangers at Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) plants have failed catastrophically due to mercury corrosion, costing hundreds of millions of dollars of damage and injuring workers.  Current monitoring methods cannot operate at the high pressures found in the process gas lines, leading to inaccurate measurements and unreliable instruments. LNG is a growing share of global energy as natural gas replaces more carbon intensive fossil fuels. By 2020, 30 LNG plants will be operating world wide, for a total mercury monitoring market of $136 million. Mercury monitoring at petrochemical facilities broadly is a $216 million per year market.  Mercury itself is a neurotoxin and a global pollutant; our sensor has the potential to aid in efforts to detect and remove mercury before it can impact human health. Beyond mercury, plasmonic sensing is a novel technology with applications for a variety of chemical and biological species.

    The intellectual merit of this project derives from the utilization of a novel sensing platform based on the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of a gold nanoparticle film. It will build upon the success of the Phase I project, which demonstrated the suitability of LSPR sensors for the detection of elemental mercury vapor. This Phase II project will proceed along two objectives. The first objective will be to adapt the sensor for operations at high pressure; included in this objective is the redesign of key components of the system and the construction of a high-pressure test bench.  The second objective is testing the LSPR sensor in a natural gas matrix; preliminary results indicate that LSPR mercury sensors response well in methane, but the full range of response and lifetime performance will be investigated in this project. Upon completion of these two objectives, field trials will commence. The full system will be certified for use in a gas plant and demonstrated at a suitable natural gas plant. A commercial prototype LSPR based natural gas mercury monitor will be realized upon completion of this project.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will further develop and commercialize an innovative coating which minimizes the accumulation of mineral fouling on industrial heat exchanger surfaces.  Heat exchangers are used to heat or cool fluids in industrial processes, such as chemical manufacturing, oil refining, power generation, food processing, electronics manufacturing, and many more.  Air conditioning for factories and large commercial buildings also represents a significant use of heat exchangers.  Fouling occurs when naturally dissolved minerals in water, often called "hard" water, precipitate out of the water when it contacts a hot surface.  This fouling can be seen in a typical home on the surface of a teakettle or showerhead.  The resulting mineral crystals adhere strongly, and form an insulating layer that materially reduces the thermal efficiency of industrial heat exchangers.  Mineral fouling is estimated to cost U.S. industry $40 Billion per year, and waste $3 Billion of energy, representing upwards of 1% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.  In addition to wasting energy, this worldwide, never-ending problem increases factory downtime and maintenance costs, causes industry to spend large amounts on chemical treatment of water supplies, and decreases the useful life of heat exchanger systems.  An effective coating will result in substantial environmental benefits including the elimination of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the wasted energy, and a reduction of the water treatment chemicals, which eventually enter community wastewater streams.

    The coating material is a low surface energy, self-assembling hydrophobic material which is a composite of a host polymer and a nanoparticle. The low surface energy of the coating impedes the attachment of the minerals to the coated heat transfer surface. Phase I results showed that any fouling accumulation on a coated surface exhibits low adhesion strength, which allows any fouling that does occur to predominantly be dislodged by the force of the water flowing over it - a phenomenon call "self-cleaning."  The coating is very thin - less than 500 nm - which minimizes impedance of heat transfer due to the presence of the coating itself.  Phase II research will focus on optimizing the properties of the coating, including substrate adhesion, surface energy, and toughness to ensure a useful life under industrial conditions.  This will be accomplished by changing the host polymer chemistry to facilitate self-assembly, and also by changing the chemistry of the nanoparticle to obtain a covalent bond between the host polymer and nanoparticle.  Work will also be performed to design the application process for industrial scale, and validate lab results with field trials at industrial sites.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the expedited development of a novel non-surgical medical device and therapeutic treatment for the approximately 1 in 3 women over the age of 30 who suffer from urinary incontinence, two thirds of whom, in part due to notable deficiencies of available solutions, elect to live without treatment while their symptoms progressively worsen. Urinary incontinence, although a very private concern, has far-reaching physical, psychological, social, and economic implications. For example, urinary incontinence has been found to reduce health-related quality of life measures on par with depression, incontinence is the number one reason for admittance into nursing homes, and the annual cost to the US healthcare system is estimated at $25 billion. Through design and validation activities this project will demonstrate the functionality of a wearable device that provides discreet, comfortable, easy-to-use therapy for female stress urinary incontinence. The technological understanding gained through this work lays the groundwork for subsequent commercialization of an FDA cleared product that will enhance the lives of tens of millions of American women.

    The proposed project provides a new framework for wearable therapeutics by enabling the patient to treat incontinence via discreet surface electrical stimulation without interruption to daily activity. Current non-surgical care often involves electrical stimulation via intravaginal probe, a treatment most woman are not willing to adopt or maintain. This project builds on successful Phase I feasibility work in which a contiguous array of cutaneous electrodes placed proximate the perineal tissue to deliver sufficient electrical muscle stimulation to promote pelvic floor toning were shown to maintain this efficacy under conditions associated with continuous wear.  The Phase II project goal is to develop an incontinence specific electrical muscle stimulator to function with the electrode array.  The system architecture will enable manipulation of the therapeutic waveform to support future multi-armed clinical studies designed to test the efficacy of various treatment regimens.  The system will also track treatment frequency, duration and intensity to provide information to clinical researchers.  Activity will include design, prototype fabrication, performance testing, human factors assessments, iteration and electrical safety validation.  Refinements to the electrode array are also anticipated.  The project will deliver a device suitable for future evaluation a human clinical studies, FDA clearance and product commercialization.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will enable a commercial implementation of holographic video microscopy, a fast, precise and flexible technology for measuring the properties of individual colloidal particles suspended in fluid media. This disruptive technology solves critical manufacturing problems across industries that work with colloidal dispersions.  Demonstrated applications include: 1) monitoring the growth of nanoparticle agglomerates in precision slurries used to polish semiconductor wafers where scratches due to slurry agglomerates are responsible for waste valued at $1 billion annually; 2) tracking concentrations of dangerous contaminants in wastewater streams; and 3) measuring the concentration of protein aggregates in biopharmaceuticals, a safety concern noted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in this $250 billion industry.  Holographic video microscopy is unique among particle-characterization technologies in providing comprehensive information about the size, shape and composition of individual particles in real time and in situ. Having access to this wealth of data facilitates product development, creates new opportunities for process control and provides a new tool for quality assurance across a broad spectrum of industries enabling safer, less expensive products for consumers while providing cost savings to manufacturers.

    The technical objectives of this project are: 1) to optimize the design of the underlying holographic microscopy system without compromising the quality of results; 2) to enable quantitative concentration determination including corrections for perturbations introduced by flow dynamics; 3) to expand the domain of operation to characterize non-spherical particles and 4) to apply machine-learning algorithms for automated robust operation.  Using holographic video microscopy for commercial applications requires adaptation and innovation in the design of the prototype instrument that was used to demonstrate feasibility. Streamlining the optical train will require advanced modeling and the creation of new methods of correcting optical aberrations to enable ease of manufacture. Additional improvements in design will include advances in improving microfluidic flow control to generate accurate concentration determination, to adapt holographic analysis algorithms for characterizing the structure of aspheric particles, and to extend analytical capabilities for turbid fluids. Finally, innovative machine-learning using neural network algorithms demonstrated significant improvements for analytical robustness in Phase I and will be extended to a wider range of applications. The Phase II effort will enable holographic video microscopy of real-world samples with typical measurement times of a few minutes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project includes new ways to inform, educate, advertise or entertain through a technology called projection mapping. This technology uses commodity video projectors to augment the surfaces of ordinary objects; applications range from advertising, events, and entertainment, to educational experiences at museums or schools, healthcare applications for rehabilitation and visualization, and simulation (e.g. military or employee training). Through multiple deployments at retail locations across the country, the company's prototypes have demonstrated that these applications will benefit not only the brands and companies that employ the technology, but also the end-users (students, consumers, etc), resulting in better engagement and faster learning when compared to achieving these same tasks through other media such as videos. Research performed during the Phase II project will allow the company to develop a scalable product and fulfill many deployments, bringing projection mapping to new markets. A free version of the company's software will also be available for non-commercial and academic use, enabling interdisciplinary research in fine arts and computer science. The R&D results generated from the research will be published and disseminated to the public.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will build a commercially viable and scalable projection mapping system. While projection mapping has a long academic history, this captivating medium still remains out of commercial reach. As learned from over 50 customer discovery interviews, retailers are shifting towards location-based experiences to increase customer engagement and sales. Many other industries have a similar need to attract attention and convey information, but without a scalable product that can be easily deployed and maintained, they lack the means to provide these experiences. To address this need, the company will develop hardware and software systems to enable captivating and immersive projection mapping experiences. The core of this system is in software: the developed algorithms will robustly calibrate projection mapping systems comprising any number of projectors/cameras, automatically align projected content to the scene and perform color-correction when the display surfaces are non-white/textured. These algorithms will be validated through standard benchmarks, resulting in novel, state-of-the-art practices. Additionally, these methods will allow for reusable projection mapping content, a critical feature lacking in existing software, as well as cloud deployment and monitoring. New hardware configurations will also be developed to achieve new uses for projection mapping.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is its potential to revolutionize human-machine interfaces, with possible applications in computer-aided design (CAD); military, maintenance, and pilot training interfaces; industrial and construction operator interfaces; robotic and laparoscopic surgery; physical therapy, rehabilitation, and swing training; education; telerobotics; automotive navigation and safety systems; and video games. While haptic interactions in these applications can already be portrayed with desktop robotic force feedback devices, the developed haptic technology could provide realistic haptic feedback at a much lower price point (required for consumer devices) and unlike current force feedback devices, the developed haptic devices can be used to naturally interact in large workspace applications like motion-input video games or VR experiences. The proposed research will enhance the scientific understanding of human-haptic and multi-modal interactions in virtual environments, and will create a model for this technology to migrate into adjacent fields.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to meet the market demand for intuitive, immersive, and inexpensive haptic technologies in the emerging field of consumer virtual reality (VR). Multiple companies are now making inexpensive 3D head-mounted displays (HMDs) for VR, but current haptic interfaces are either too expensive, have limited range of motion, or are too crude to portray realistic haptic interactions in VR. The company has created an ungrounded haptic motion controller that utilizes a new form of touch feedback that applies in-hand shear forces to create compelling physical feedback at a price that is viable for consumer markets. The proposed research objectives are based on feedback from key stakeholders and VR enthusiasts who have tried the company?s current high-end haptic controllers. Their feedback suggests improving the overall user experience of the controllers through reducing device size, mass, and system latency, while improving device ergonomics and reducing cost. The Phase II research builds on the findings of Phase I, which showed that even simpler implementations of the newly developed haptic technology were still found to be more compelling than traditional vibration feedback. The project will result in a reference design that can be mass produced.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be in the field of healthcare.  The United States spends approximately $9,000 per person per year on healthcare.  Ultrasound medical imaging is a medical imaging technology that could lower costs by providing an alternative to higher-cost imaging techniques.  The technology created during this Phase II project is expected to increase the quality, value, and accessibility of medical ultrasound, which would in turn reduce medical imaging costs in the US healthcare system.  Furthermore, the company's technology is expected to bring ultrasound to more clinical settings and improve system-wide efficiencies in the diagnosis and treatment of disease.  The technology also has commercial potential in the international market, with $5.8B spent annually on medical ultrasound devices worldwide.  Finally, by improving the utility of ultrasound, the technology will lead to improved patient care and may ultimately save lives.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop deep learning technology for ultrasound imaging in medicine.  Ultrasound imaging has numerous benefits including real-time image acquisition, non-invasive scanning, low-cost devices, and no known side-effects (it is non-ionizing).  However, variability in quality has encumbered its adoption and utility.  As a result, more expensive imaging is typically utilized, often exposing patients to ionizing radiation.  Our objective is to develop, improve, and test machine learning techniques, based on deep learning, to improve ultrasound acquisition and interpretation.  We expect this project will create novel technologies that make ultrasound easier to use and improve the quality of ultrasound examinations.  The end result will improve the quality, value, and accessibility of medical ultrasound examinations, will result in cost savings to the healthcare system, will produce improvements in patient care, and will support a sustainable business opportunity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of technology for the intracellular delivery of biomolecules directly into cells. This microfluidics-based platform has the potential to become an enabling technology for intracellular delivery, which may be used to accelerate drug discovery R&D by allowing reliable, efficient delivery of diverse material classes without having to engineer the material or the cell to natively uptake these molecules. Such capabilities could allow pharmaceutical companies to assess the efficacy of drug candidates faster than ever before, especially with integration into high-throughput robotic workflows that are already well-established and efficacious. The technology could dramatically reduce the time to market for new drugs by decoupling determination of a candidate's activity from the cell's affinity for the molecule. It also could facilitate a deeper understanding of biological processes and pathways. Initial studies with leading drug developers and academic laboratories towards this goal have been very encouraging, and, in the future, the platform could potentially enable robust engineering of cell function for cell-based therapies targeting a diversity of diseases including influenza, cancer, and even autoimmune disorders.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes the continued development of the intracellular delivery technology to address relevant applications in drug discovery R&D. New drug discovery is often hampered by the inability of membrane-impermeable drug candidates to enter the cell cytosol, necessitating exogenous materials for delivery such as strong electric fields or viral vectors. However, these materials tend to cause off-target effects or toxicity, presenting a need for a technology that can facilitate delivery without altering post-treatment cellular function. The goal of this project is to demonstrate a platform geared towards market adoption of microfluidic hardware as the standard method for transfection and intracellular delivery. During Phase II, the platform will be fully-characterized, validated, and verified in order to produce the consistent, repeatable results necessary to achieve market entry. In addition, research is planned to demonstrate the ability of the platform to support drug discovery R&D by developing the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system for use with this intracellular delivery technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that it will dramatically increase the efficiency of communications networks. Commercially, the ability to dynamically, adaptively and optimally route traffic on data networks will lead to network cost savings ranging from 60% - 70% for network service providers. Critically, the project leverages the recent industry shift towards software-defined networking (SDN) that is projected to become a $45 billion market by 2020. The excitement behind SDN is driven primarily by the promised performance benefits of better traffic control. By bringing to market its provably optimal, dynamic and adaptive traffic control algorithms, the company will be uniquely positioned to capitalize on this market opportunity. The immediate resulting social impact will be that end users will have access to faster, cheaper and more robust data networks. In the longer term, efficient software control of networks will enable rapid innovation in networking leading to new network applications that have not even been envisioned yet. The project also enhances technological and scientific understanding by commercially verifying the company's solution to a longstanding open problem in networking - namely, whether an easy to deploy, dynamic, adaptive and optimal routing algorithm can be found.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on delivering commercial, smart, traffic control algorithms that can unlock the full capacity of modern communications networks. Today, due to unprecedented traffic growth, network operators face major challenges in the form of efficient resource utilization. The problem is that the inherent randomness of data traffic has led to network designers over-provisioning networks to the point where they run at 30% - 40% utilization on average. The company's competitive advantage is a new algorithm that allows it to optimally manage traffic variations by adjusting network routes in real time while retaining the scalability and simplicity of today's protocols. The goal in this project is to build on the beta tests from Phase I by developing an enterprise-grade, cloud-based network control application that is ready for general market launch. To this end, the company will start with small commercial deployments at selected test partners. Feedback from these deployments will be used to iron out any issues before general market launch. By the end of the project, the company anticipates generating significant revenue from initial customers as it continues to innovate and maintain its current lead in developing SDN control plane software.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enable the availability of a revolutionary manufacturing process for pharmaceuticals. The project consists of the development of novel process technologies, as well as the integration of these processes into an end-to-end continuous manufacturing line that can produce drugs continuously (24/7 basis). This is different from the current methodology that produces large quantities of drugs at discrete time points (e.g. large batch quantities are produced several times a year).  A working pilot plant of this process demonstrated significant operational advantages with a marketed drug-production time was reduced from 200 days to 2 days, plant footprint decreased by 90%, projected costs reduced by 50%, while improving product quality.  The impact on society will be considerable: patients will receive better quality drugs; drug shortages will be greatly reduced; and pharmaceutical companies will be able to manufacture and distribute their drugs in a much more cost-effective and efficient manner, allowing them to reallocate more capital to Research and Development (new drugs developed).  Finally, it will be possible to relocate manufacturing plants and jobs back in the U.S. (more efficient processes = lower costs).

    The proposed project builds upon a successful Phase I SBIR project, as well as five years of collaboration between a premier research institution and a leading pharmaceutical company aimed at developing a novel continuous manufacturing process to overcome the limitations of the current standard, batch manufacturing.  The first objective of this NSF project is to further develop two novel elements of a multistep, continuous manufacturing process (i.e. heterogeneous crystallization and electrospinning for solid dosage forms), so they run reliably under different operating conditions. This is important because commercial production requires that they perform consistently and reliably 24/7. Thus, these novel unit operations will be studied under different operating conditions and starting materials, while their design is optimized.  Success will be defined when the unit operations achieve: 1) maximal operational efficiency, 2) industry standard manufacturing capabilities, and 3) qualification to be used across the Research and Development manufacturing spectrum.  The second objective is to integrate these two units into a broader end-to-end continuous manufacturing process capable of producing high-quality pharmaceuticals on a continuous basis. The integrated process will also feature three unit operations on separation, filtration and drying that were developed during Phase I of this SBIR project.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project allows for a more effective glaucoma treatment by adjusting eye pressure based on disease progression for each patient. In 2015, the US glaucoma market is estimated to be over $2 billion and our addressable market, glaucoma surgical therapies, is estimated to be $534M. The incidence for glaucoma increases with age, and as the baby boomer population gets older, there will be a growing need for glaucoma treatments. To treat glaucoma, patients undergo lifelong drug regimens, multiple laser procedures, and invasive surgical procedures. However, even with all these treatment options glaucoma patients still go blind from glaucoma. The proposed novel design and approach to glaucoma will personalize the treatment for patients and remove the need for numerous and costly procedures. Most importantly, the personalization of glaucoma therapy will optimize visual protection for every patient.

    The proposed project will validate the safety and efficacy of a glaucoma drainage device to adjust and set pressure in the eye. Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness and is only treatable by reducing eye pressure. Surgical treatments are unpredictable with suboptimal success rates based primarily on the choice of drainage site. The proposed novel device drains to a new area of the eye to avoid the complications and unpredictability associated with the current glaucoma surgeries. The device also can provide the first-ever personalized treatment for millions of glaucoma sufferers by fine-tuning pressure based on the needs of the patient throughout his or her lifetime. Phase I/IB studies have shown feasibility of the device with an adjustable component.  However, its efficacy and safety have yet to be fully investigated. Therefore, in this Phase II research grant, we will optimize the device for safety and efficacy and perform the necessary preclinical testing according to FDA standards to further develop the product.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a new analytical chemistry instrument for rapid quantitation of residual chemical impurities in complex mixtures. The target application for this project is the detection of genotoxic impurities during early drug development in pharmaceutical manufacturing. The instrument to be developed uses Fourier transform molecular rotational resonance (FT-MRR) spectroscopy to identify molecules based on their three dimensional geometry, which permits high chemical specificity.  FT-MRR is a high-resolution spectroscopy technique that makes it possible to directly analyze gas mixtures containing a large number of chemicals without the need for prior chemical separation using chromatography - a time-consuming step of current analysis methods that requires significant technical supervision.  As a result, FT-MRR based chemical analysis instruments have the potential to speed up innovation for pharmaceutical manufacturers by reducing analytical development cycles from weeks to hours during the high-throughput drug innovation process.  Chemical analysis instruments using FT-MRR spectroscopy enable faster innovation in research and development labs with the added benefit of seamless method transferability to on-line process monitoring applications and routine quality control for final product release.

    The ability to transfer analysis methods into routine analysis is important to the industry goal of continuous manufacturing for pharmaceuticals.  It is enabled for FT-MRR in part (yet critically) by the two main objectives of this Phase II effort: the development of sampling automation for FT-MRR and the design of a cost-reduced, targeted FT-MRR system.  Concepts for both of these designs were successfully tested during Phase I.  The intellectual merit of this project is the introduction of a new technique for chemical analysis that senses chemicals based on the absolute molecular structure, with no orthogonal analysis required.  FT-MRR spectral fingerprints can distinguish molecular isomers, conformers, isotopologues, and even enantiomers.  With this kind of absolute structure information, FT-MRR can enable new studies that trace chemical pathways with site-specific isotopic ratio information and chiral detection.  Both concepts are otherwise very challenging with current technology.  The FT-MRR instrument to be built for this project combines recent advances in high-power, solid-state millimeter wave (mm-wave) light sources, low-cost microwave synthesizer integrated circuits, and high-speed digital electronics to implement a time-domain, Fourier transform (FT) measurement approach.  Standard methods for chemical sampling will be integrated to maximize the ease-of-use and robustness of FT-MRR instruments.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to reduce the cost of solar generated electricity
    by increasing the efficiency of panels and reducing cleaning and maintenance costs.
    This improvement is created using a nanoscale glass coating that increases transmittance
    of single side coated solar PV glass and creates an antifogging and self-cleaning
    surface.  These savings increase with photovoltaic device efficiencies as well,
    so as the next generation of solar cells will see even greater benefit from the
    proposed innovation. Reducing the cost per watt of solar generated electricity
    is one of the grand energy challenges and has immense societal and governmental
    impacts. The proposed project is one component of addressing that challenge. The
    technical advances made in this project will also be applicable to additional
    market opportunities in LED lighting and other cutting-edge markets.\t\n\nThis
    Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project investigates the deposition
    of water-based nanoparticle solutions using industrially scalable methods and
    results in valuable scientific knowledge that is not currently available in the
    field. Nanoparticle-based antireflective glass coatings have been presented in
    both the scientific literature and commercial products. However, most coatings
    suffer from either high deposition costs, or a trade-off between durability and
    performance. In this project, methods to increase the durability of a low-cost,
    high-performance nanoparticle that were developed in the Phase I project are scaled
    to high throughput and low cost fabrication methods. The process/structure/property
    relationships of this novel coating will be investigated and lead to new scientific
    knowledge related to the large-scale deployment of nanoparticle based technologies.
    The coated glass will be subjected to industry standard reliability and durability
    tests. The expected outcome of this work is the demonstration of this technology
    at a pilot level with industry collaborators."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the significant improvement of
    surgical accuracy, which will dramatically reduce surgical errors, improve outcomes and
    reduce healthcare costs. In spine surgery alone, there are more than 500,000
    procedures every year in the US utilizing implants such as screws. In 4% to 11% of
    these surgeries, the implant placement is inaccurate. For the patient this translates into
    longer recoveries - from days to weeks - and in many cases into a second revision
    surgery. The patient is non-productive, unable to carry out their daily routines for weeks,
    while the healthcare system has to absorb the costs of the longer recovery as well as
    the revision surgeries. For both the healthcare and economic systems these are
    avoidable costs. The medical imaging technology being developed in this project has
    the potential to eliminate surgical inaccuracies across the $2.4B market of image
    guidance, improving clinical applications that range from orthopedic surgery to minimally
    invasive vascular interventions, to cancer diagnosis and treatments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will demonstrate a
    novel imaging modality, which provides near-real-time 3D live imaging - 4D - during
    surgery. This novel system will provide surgical imaging at a lower x-ray dose than
    fluoroscopy (current standard), with a geometry that allows concurrent imaging with
    surgery. This 4D technology has the potential to significantly reduce surgical
    inaccuracies, improve outcomes and reduce costs. Phase 1 successfully demonstrated
    the feasibility of the reconstruction algorithm used by the proposed imaging modality by
    showing its potential of higher surgical accuracy in a single spinal screw insertion. This
    Phase 2 project will I) prove the robustness of the reconstruction algorithm across a
    variety of use-cases, II) demonstrate the clinical usability of the 4D scanner, and III)
    confirm the clinical utility of the scanner. The clinical usability will be studied with an
    ergonomic model in a surgical setting. The clinical utility will be proven by building a
    system prototype and performing image quality and x-ray dose comparisons versus
    fluoroscopy and 3D in a realistic surgical setting. Preliminary results show that these
    objectives are achievable. This research is readying the technology for clinical research,
    regulatory clearance and commercialization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from the development  of a new class of graphical-media-design system that lies between today's 2D digital paint systems and 3D computer-aided design systems. This technology will allow architects, engineers, artists, and school children to create compelling 3D experiences directly from their drawings without extensive training. Furthermore, it will accelerate the creation of interactive 3D content and significantly reduce the time, cost and expertise currently required to create it. By bridging the gap between traditional drawings and 3D modeling, this project will provide the unique ability to reuse and "reproject" drawn strokes, thus enabling the creation of expressive 3D drawings with minimal effort. The technology developed in this project will help lower the barrier and generate new business opportunities in content creation for electronic publishing and for other creative professionals, such as architects, designers, and ad-agency art directors. Finally, this project includes specific outreach activities, through collaboration with the American Museum of Natural History, that will provide unique educational services to the local community, while simultaneously introducing this new technology to the world.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will focus on making the creation of this new type of graphical media as intuitive and fluid as paper and pencil. This Phase II project will support system improvements - including user-interface improvements - to simplify 3D navigation for the consumers of this media. This will be needed for using this media in digital children's picture books, which have already been identified as early adopters of this technology as well as an important market. Another technical objective will be to develop a hybrid vector-raster representation, which will provide a wider range of artistic expression, while improving rendering performance of large scenes. A third objective is to develop stroke deformation algorithms to support direct manipulation of objects and characters to provide sketch-driven animation capabilities.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will pursue the full development of a novel system design architecture for thermoelectric generation (TEG) to recover exhaust waste heat from engines and convert it to electricity.  The effort will build upon Phase I achievements, which included a successful feasibility demonstration of a fractional proof-of-concept prototype and development and validation of a computer model, thereby proving the viability of this new system technology platform.  The technology enables efficient performance within a very compact and cost-effective form that also can easily scale in capacity.  The Phase II effort will involve improving subsystems and designing, modeling, fabricating, and testing a full TEG system for a passenger car application.  Furthermore, scalability will be explored by applying the TEG to a larger vehicle platform.

    the broader/commercial impact of this project lie in the fact that industry has found it very challenging to develop a TEG system design that meets market metrics of performance, reliability, compactness, and low-cost, particularly for automotive applications.  The proposed TEG system architecture, which includes a novel exhaust gas heat exchanger uniquely integrated into the remaining system, shows strong potential for meeting such metrics, and thereby achieving significant reduction in vehicle fuel consumption and emissions.  By penetrating the large passenger vehicle market, initial market introduction could easily range in the 100,000s and much more if the cost of the product is extremely low.  Broader opportunities to recover exhaust waste heat for transportation include medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, which may also be addressed by this scalable technology.  Other adjacent markets include stationary and mobile generator sets, solid-oxide fuel cells, and potentially, aircraft propulsion systems.  This commercial impact would greatly support national energy independence and greenhouse gas reductions.

    a clinical software version with formal verification and validation testing; and
    3) Prepare the device for clinical use with human subjects and experimentally
    validate in an ex vivo porcine lumbar spine model with physician testing. It is

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop instrumentation that will allow researchers to elucidate fundamental interactions at the atomic scale that occur at high-temperature and various timescales.  From advanced automobile manufacturing to computer chips, virtually all developing technologies require processing materials at high temperatures to enhance their properties.  The proposed optical delivery system will enable researchers and manufacturers to efficiently study materials at unprecedented temperature, time, and length scales, and thus bring new products to market faster.  Furthermore, the system will provide engineers and scientists a new platform for rapidly advancing emerging technologies that are limited by understanding high-temperature and excited-state materials phenomena.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will design, assemble and test an optical delivery system specifically suitable for nano- and atomic-scale characterization in a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The proposed program will deliver a system with unprecedented ability to efficiently stimulate materials in the TEM via highly-localized photothermal and photoexcited modalities. The photothermal modality will enable agile, non-invasive, and ubiquitous access to TEM specimens, and enable studies of unique temperature and temporal regimes not accessible using standard resistive heating systems. The proposed integrated temperature measurement system will allow closed-loop feedback and control of the precise temperature. The excitation modality will enable researchers to image and characterize optically excited states of materials at the nanoscale. The proposed instrumentation consists of fiber-coupled optical heating and excitation channels positioned by a specially-designed nanomanipulator for accurate x-y-z positioning. In addition to the hardware development, appropriate software controls will be developed for the optical sources and the nanomanipulator system.

  title: 'SBIR Phase II:  A Novel Approach To STEM Education Through A Personalized
    Mobile Cooking App For K-8 Students'
- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase II Project will produce a cooperative applied video
    game challenge where students work together within an active, simulated environment
    to collect and analyze data, construct explanations, then test and iterate solutions
    to a problem. Only 22% of the United States? graduating high school seniors are
    proficient in science. This is important due to the estimated 2.4 million unfilled
    jobs in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) in the United States,
    to provide higher-paying STEM jobs to citizens, and promote a scientifically literate
    citizenry. Recent research supports new approaches for how to improve this scientific
    literacy, and states across the country are adopting new science standards to
    support this effort. The outcome of this project will support development of students'
    scientific literacy with a novel approach which utilizes cooperative, interdisciplinary,
    problem-based learning within a video game. Commercialization of this product
    will transform the process of inquiry-based learning by putting the tools in the
    hands of student scientists as they test their own solutions. The project supports
    the NSF's mission by empowering students to develop strong science and engineering
    skills, as well as supporting development of 21st century skills such as collaboration
    and problem solving that are desired by employers. \n\n\nThe technology developed
    by this Phase II project will produce a group problem-solving experience for up
    to five students to analyze a problem and implement an engineering solution within
    a live simulated environment, providing educators with a powerful curricula tool
    to engage their students in the real problem-solving cycles a scientist would
    engage in, within a feasible setting using the video game. The research goals
    include creating a flexible content authoring tool that designers and educators
    can use to generate their own unique scenarios and creating an easy-to-use educator
    dashboard to accompany it. The content authoring and customization options empower
    educators to reflect local context, student interest, and student background knowledge,
    strategies which are essential for educators of diverse populations currently
    underrepresented within STEM. The technology and its dashboard will also serve
    as a powerful formative assessment tool, enabling group assessment that is able
    to parse group and individual participation, and is designed to promote balanced
    group problem solving. The result of this research will create a uniquely flexible
    tool that will enable educators to engage learners in deeper, contextual learning,
    encourage transfer of information, cooperative learning, development of science
    and engineering skills such as data literacy, and be utilized for assessment of
    these skills.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed
    worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit
    and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide accurate indoor location services to users via existing mobile electronic devices like smartphones and tablets. This technology will bring many of the applications powered by GPS, like navigation, tracking and location-based advertising to indoor markets. We propose using a hybrid ultrasound and RF-based beaconing system to enable sub-20cm location accuracy within large, GPS-denied environments. Our approach is unique in that it is compatible with current smartphones by simply downloading an app. The system uses an infrastructure comprised of beacons, which can be powered through indoor solar energy-harvesting instead of requiring expensive electrical wiring. Accurate indoor location-aware mobile applications can enhance applications ranging from retail, healthcare and manufacturing, all the way to building navigation, asset tracking and aiding the visually impaired.

    The proposed project aims to develop a robust localization platform which can localize off-the-shelf devices like smartphones and tablets as well as low-cost radio frequency (RF) tags to better than 20cm accuracy in indoor locations that do not have access to GPS. Current indoor localization technologies for smartphones often fall short in terms of accuracy, especially in highly dynamic environments with obstructions. Our system utilizes energy harvesting beacons with an array of speakers to transmit time-of-flight ranging signals in the near-ultrasound spectrum. These signals can be recorded and demodulated in software by commodity smartphones, while being inaudible to humans. The research in this phase will aim to develop the methods and technologies required to streamline installation to support large facilities like airports and convention centers that would require tens to hundreds of beacons. This involves the development of a mapping and commissioning system as well as hardware beacon modules for integration of our technology into the products of third parties (e.g. smart camera systems, building sensors, etc). We will also integrate the ability to track tagged assets.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase II project will explore the potential benefits of
    a sine wave shaped wheel compared to a traditional circular wheel for the central
    pivot irrigation industry. The central pivot irrigation industry is an essential
    segment of the agriculture industry and this project aims to deliver a superior
    wheel that solves the persistent issue of trench-digging that leads to equipment
    breakdown, down time, lost profits, and crop-loss. The broader significance of
    eliminating trench-digging would be significant savings for farmers, distributors
    and consumers. Agriculture is the largest industry in the world, and developing
    a wheel that eliminates an issue that plagues the industry is the central goal
    of this project. The development of a sine wave wheel also potentially impacts
    other fields as the technology can be used in over one-hundred different industries.
    \n\nThe technical innovation of this project is creating a wheel that is non-circular.
    The wheel will exhibit the blending of multiple shapes in one design including
    a sine wave, cube, circle and hexagon. It will be approximately 4.5 feet tall,
    and weighing approximately 400lbs for use in the farming industry. The concept
    is to create two wheels in tandem where the sine waves are out-of-phase from one
    another. The front wheel would create a left-right-left path into the soil, much
    like the path a snake would leave behind traversing soil. The rear wheel would
    move in an opposite right-left-right configuration leaving a double helix footprint
    in its wake. The opposing wheels would push the soil back toward center, eliminating
    the largest issue plaguing the industry: trench digging. The sine wave wheel technology
    has already been scientifically proven on a smaller scale in the skateboarding
    industry to reduce friction, increase longevity, increase off-road ability, and
    increase speed. Multiple wheel iterations will be manufactured and subsequently
    tested in this project using off-the-shelf hubs within the industry and rubber
    tires. The wheel will not be pneumatic and will never go flat.\n\nThis award reflects
    NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation

    most pervasive and toxic problems. To many, it's dirty, disgusting, and someone
    else's problem to solve. Unfortunately, we all suffer the consequences, as litter
    impacts our economy, degrades the environment, demoralizes community pride, kills
    wildlife, and poisons the food system. This project builds on the accomplishments
    of an SBIR Phase I project that developed a mobile technology empowering anyone
    to identify, map, and collect the world's litter, while simultaneously connecting
    to a broader community of associated brands, cities, schools. \n\n\nThe company
    has integrated image recognition and machine learning algorithms into its software
    to advance the crowdsourcing of litter data and cleanup activities. This advancement
    will allow for the identification of litter even if the item is in a deep state
    of decay and decomposition. This project also aims to continue building the Global
    Database of Litter, a technology platform that integrates the company's litter
    taxonomic classification with other data sets including location, time, retail
    locations, and the watershed. This data provides great potential to improve municipal
    infrastructure, resource allocation, brand packaging redesign, and individual

- abstractText: "Fuel burned for industrial process heat accounts for 20%-30% of all
    carbon emissions on the face of the earth. Yet no emissions-free solutions for
    process heat are commonly available today. Thermal energy requires burning fuel.
    Beyond the impact to local air quality and climate change, the need for fuel creates
    energy poverty both domestically and abroad. When fuel supplies are threatened,
    it can endanger the livelihoods of those that depend on the fuel.\nThe impact
    of Skyven?s solution is to turn the sun into a viable, practical source of high
    temperature thermal energy. It has the potential to dramatically reduce CO2 emissions,
    improve local air quality, reduce energy poverty, and diversify America?s energy
    supply. Just a single Skyven project of 500 collectors will offset 29,900 gallons
    of diesel fuel, equivalent to planning 4,400 trees. Skyven envisions doing thousands
    of projects across the USA and tens of thousands across the globe. One day IMA
    technology may even enable rural areas and developing nations to leapfrog natural
    gas distribution infrastructure in the same way that cellphones have leapfrogged
    landlines. This project is an opportunity for the United States to take a leadership
    role in technology to enable these societal changes.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation
    Research Phase II project will address a key barrier to solar thermal deployment
    in the industrial sector: lack of an effective interface to connect high temperature
    solar thermal system with legacy fuel-fired thermal systems.  Existing interfaces
    are limited to low temperatures (below 100?C) and utilize costly plumbing schemes
    that are prone to failure. They suffer from poor reliability and create severe
    maintenance headaches, rendering them unusable in the industrial sector.  These
    systems also typically require the host facility to be take offline during installation
    ? an costly sacrifice in the industrial sector.  The temperature limitations are
    particularly problematic, as many industrial facilities operate high temperatures
    condensate return systems that rarely drop below 100?C.  \nSkyven?s system-level
    innovations solve these challenges, making its high temperature solar thermal
    collectors a practical and financially-attractive option for industries such as
    food processing.  Phase II research will implement two innovations in particular:
    (1) solar steam injection into a traditional fuel-fired boiler; and (2) wireless
    control with automated optical calibration/commissioning algorithms and failsafe
    stagnation/overheat protection. In addition, the project will prove out high temperature
    operation up to 200C, both in outdoor laboratory-scale testbed and later in a
    real-world industrial facility.  It will also utilize advanced reliability engineering
    concepts to show long-term (20 year) reliability without requiring unlimited test
    time and testing resources.  The project will also advance knowledge in the space
    of industrial controls engineering, showing that new industrial systems can be
    integrated with existing controls through innovative controls interfacing, without
    require rework of the existing control systems.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory
    mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase II project supports development of a commercially
    viable real time optical imaging device to address the problem of failed first
    time vascular access.  Peripheral IV access (PIV) is the most common invasive
    procedure for all ages, races and clinical settings. In the United States alone,
    there are an estimated 230 million PIVs placed per year. First time IV access
    has a shockingly high failure rate of 35%-50%.  Multiple attempts result in pain
    and emotional distress, especially in the pediatric population where the failure
    rate is highest. The average cost of placing an IV on the first time is $69.76.
    \ Three or more attempts doubles the cost to be greater than $125 per IV. When
    PIV access cannot be obtained the more invasive, risky and costly central IV access
    is used which increases the risk of blood borne infections as well as other complications.
    One central IV sourced infection can add 7-20 additional days of hospital length
    of stay and $56,000 of additional (unreimbursed) cost, adding as much as $2.3
    billion in increased US intensive care unit costs each year.  These failure rates
    occur even though ultrasound and near infrared devices are available to improve
    first time IV access. \n\nIn phase II, the project team will refine the hybrid
    Optical Coherence Tomography tipped imaging probe, customized for vascular access,
    and integrate it into a commercially viable system to fulfill goals not supported
    by any other imaging system: finding and recognizing veins; guiding the angiocath
    needle to the vein; acquiring intra lumen access on first attempt; and confirming
    intra lumen placement.  The system needs to be cost effective, durable and acceptable
    to a multitude of diverse clinicians. The disposable adapter probe will connect
    to a hand piece that will tactilely enable the clinician to actuate rotation and
    advancement of the optical probe to acquire data necessary to create clinically
    relevant 3D real time images.  The data are transmitted to a control unit for
    processing and then presented to a small form display such as smart phone. Research
    activity will be focused in developing the egonomically acceptable hand piece
    that does not interfere with  variable angular approaches to the vein. A critical
    part of the ongoing research will focus on software design for creating an optimal
    graphic user interface (GUI). Multiple form factors of the hand piece, the GUI,
    and visual display will be evaluated by practicing clinicians for final production.\n\nThis

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide the $4B/year cover lens market an economically viable material for the upcoming form-factor it must address: foldable displays. While this market size currently represents displays that employ rigid LCD or OLED technologies, major handset manufacturers are looking to move to highly differentiated form-factors such as foldable phones to gain market share in the competitive flagship smartphone tier. To do so, the entire display module must be foldable and one of the last components to allow for this behavior is the cover lens. Foldable displays therefore must eliminate hard, brittle materials such as glass and utilize materials with the same excellent scratch-resistant properties of glass, but with the flexibility and durability under folding of polymers. This project develops a novel polysulfide thermoset for this application.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop the first low-cost, high-performance foldable cover lens technology using polysulfide thermosetting polymer films. Currently, the amorphous polysulfide thermosets can yield the excellent optical properties and folding durability required for application in foldable display technologies. However, these materials are as of yet unable to meet the strict hardness requirement set by manufacturers looking to replace rigid glass cover lenses. In this work, the expansion of the polysulfide thermoset family of materials will be undertaken to introduce chemical and physical modifications which allow for the resultant thermosetting films to possess the requisite hardness. The resultant resin materials will then be converted using standard wet-film extrusion and curing tools commonly found in the printing industry, allowing for cost-competitive production of the resulting films.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to provide farmers with a new class of biotechnology-based pesticides for more affordable and environmentally benign crop production by addressing an unmet need: an efficacious, selective and safe pesticide. The project will focus on a pesticide for the diamondback moth (DBM), a pest that damages Brassica crops such as canola, cabbage, cauliflower and collards.  It is the most costly invasive crop pest worldwide, for which there is no effective solution with acceptable resistance management.  DMB has developed resistance to more than 90 active ingredients in conventional insecticides, i.e., almost every insecticide class known. If successful, this biotechnology platform will contribute to sustainable food production and enhanced biodiversity with minimal use of non-selective traditional pesticides associated with human health costs.  The goal is to develop a product that is efficacious, selective, and provides improved resistance management against field populations of DMB.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project is the development of RNAi-based pesticide for the treatment of diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) infestations in cruciferous crops.  In the last five years, there have been significant advances in the methods for the production of RNAi triggers that allow the manufacturing of these materials in large quantities and at a low price, which is required for broad agricultural applications. Topical RNAi-based pesticides have been demonstrated in the lab to be very selective with respect to the intended target. They also may be readily modified to combat developed pesticide resistance by target pests. However, due to low efficacy at economically attractive application rates, very few pests and no Lepidopteran insects are currently in the RNAi list of commercial targets. This project specifically addresses the challenges related to RNAi efficacy, and the development of the proposed technology could be applied to Lepidopteran control and other biotechnology applications. The outcome of the proposed research would provide the first example of a scalable RNAi-based insecticide targeting Plutella xylostella or any Lepidopteran.

    This SBIR Phase II project demonstrates and clinically validates a novel, non-invasive imaging technology to detect diabetic retinopathy before structural damage occurs. Diabetic retinopathy is among the leading causes of vision loss in the world. This devastating complication of both type I and II diabetes results in structural damage to the sensitive vasculature of the retina. Once structural damage is inflicted, it is difficult, if not impossible, to ameliorate it. Small changes in the retinal vasculature's oxygen saturation have been shown to be a reliable indicator of diabetic retinopathy before structural damage occurs. Since there is no clinical non-invasive technology capable of detecting these small functional changes, a major need exists for new retinal oximetry technologies. Diabetic retinopathy affects 200 million people worldwide. The American Diabetes Association reports that the cost of diabetes in the US in 2012 was $245 billion, including $69 billion in reduced productivity and $176 billion in medical costs. Since 40% of diabetics are anticipated to develop diabetic retinopathy, the estimated economic cost of diabetic retinopathy is $98 billion annually. By mitigating the occurrence of diabetic retinopathy, this technology will help reduce the cost of diabetic retinopathy treatment, its overall economic burden, and help save the vision of millions of people around the world.

    The primary technical innovation behind the proposed technology is its use of a novel physics-based model to overcome the challenges of high-resolution retinal imaging. These challenges include the multi-layered structure of the retina, absorbance dynamics, and the need to produce an image in one snapshot to reduce motion artifacts. Compared with existing methods based on structural imaging, the successful outcome of this project will become a commercial technology-of-choice for ophthalmologists around the world, enabling cost-effective detection of early stage diabetic retinopathy or pre-retinopathy. The development of the technology proceeds through iterative optimization between laboratory and real-use environments to generate robust, validated data. Specifically, in Phase II, the research objectives of the project are pursued in two parallel tracks: 1) refinement of the core imaging system, and 2) validation using model and human subjects in a clinical environment. The outcome of this project will be an easy-to-use, reliable diagnostic imaging and monitoring technology with proven clinical utility in detecting the onset of diabetic retinopathy based on functional properties, before structural damage has occurred in the patient.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that unplanned outages of power generation gas turbines are increasingly occurring which pose a risk of $1.6 billion to gas turbine manufacturers across an average fleet of 500 annually on power services contracts. Using these sensors to measure blade surface temperatures will replace the significant cost of unplanned outages, by revealing when combustors are over firing to enable operators to take corrective measures. According to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, power generation gas turbines accounted for 1.3 million tons of NOx and SOx emissions. NOx emissions are increased due to erroneous combustor firing. This project would also lead to acceleration of adoption for developmental engines owing to reduced cost and labor requirements associated with measurement instrumentation installation. Also, this can be used in monitoring harsh environment parameters in remotely inaccessible locations, while providing insight to control systems increasing the efficiency of systems in nuclear reactors and chemical processing plants.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a polymer-derived ceramics (PDC) sensor system for gas turbine engine's blade surface temperature measurement. Currently, no sensors exist that can survive these harsh environments in-situ. This innovation combines unique, wireless, passive, corrosion-resistant PDC-based resonators bonded directly on the blade surface along with high temperature PDC-based antenna for operating in harsh environments. The research objectives are to miniaturize & optimize the sensor utilizing  different PDCs; fabrication & validation of high temperature antenna; characterization of PDC material properties, microstructural changes, degradation of sensing performance, bonding mechanism evaluation after long term exposure to high temperatures (~1000C) in a furnace & burner rig. The prototype, including integrated multiple sensors, high temperature antenna & user data interface, will be operated on a rotating micro-turbine to demonstrate performance in actual operating environments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project relates to the notion of distributed manufacturing using 3D printing, where structural parts may be manufactured onsite, meeting on-demand needs while eliminating transportation costs and inventory storage.  Unique, one-off prints, such as may often occur in the medical industry are another virtue of 3D print technology.  For these reasons, virtually every major US manufacturing industry is exploring avenues to utilize 3D printing.  While 3D printing is unquestionably entering the mainstream of manufacturing technology, a glaring gap in advancing the industry is the simulation of the performance of an "as manufactured" part.  A common question surrounding 3D print manufacturing today is: "How do I know if my part will perform as envisioned?" The proposed technology brings an industry leading software simulation to the product engineer and designer to answer this very question, enabling engineers to predict part performance, prior to attempting a build. The speed and simplicity of the software solution is transformative, accelerating the adoption of this disruptive manufacturing technology.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the technical challenge of predicting structural performance of an "as manufactured" fiber-reinforced 3D printed part. Additive Manufacturing (AM) offers the product engineer or designer tremendous freedom to create parts not achievable by more traditional processes.  However, parts produced by AM are fundamentally different than those produced by conventional methods.  For example, a machined aluminum part is largely homogenous, while a 3D printed part allows for internal lattice (infill) structures.  A 3D printed part can also exhibit a multitude of process anomalies such as voids, delamination between layers, warping produced by residual stresses as the part cools, and, in the case of fiber filled plastics, fiber orientation that varies throughout the part.  Collectively, these features can have a dramatic impact on the ultimate performance of the part and must be understood by the engineer early in the design stage.  This project seeks to develop a commercial software simulation product that predicts the structural performance of a part produced by 3D printing, while optimizing the infill (lattice) structure for strength and weight. Speed, simplicity, and high-fidelity results are hallmarks of the proposed solution and are at the core of the value proposition.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will allow highly cost effective, 2-way communications to be delivered to machinery and 'Things' over extremely long and non-line-of-sight distances using underutilized frequencies and new hardware and software techniques. The resulting technologies will provide 2-way connectivity where cellular does not exist and where other techniques (Satellite) are too expensive. This will result in near universal availability of the Internet-of-Things at costs superior to legacy approaches and which are appropriate for applications typically seen in Internet-of-Things applications. Further, the work will have broad impact in allowing more balanced utilization of the radio spectrum which cannot be addressed (either economically or at all) with legacy wireless techniques.

    The proposed project will create a new system of hardware, software, frequency and operating techniques which will allow underutilized spectrum to be used to deliver 2-way communications to very remote machines and things. The work will build on our Phase I accomplishments to create production-ready designs of two new wireless systems, signal processing software to allow use of challenging spectrum while avoiding existing users, create the first instance of a cloud based infrastructure for automated control and coordination of our architecture, and, the creation of a basic set of deployment tools and techniques to support field operations. We expect to continue building a significant base of Intellectual Property as we pursue the work.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that the technology provides health care systems with a very accurate view of what their patients experience during health care encounters - what is going well and importantly, what specific problems are frustrating patients. With this insight, providers are able to quickly and efficiently resolve issues. Patients are increasingly active in deciding where they receive care.  As health care spending declines, providers find themselves competing for patients. To attract patients and drive market share, health systems must deliver not just excellent clinical care but also positive patient experiences.  Patients that have a negative health care encounter often choose to go elsewhere.  When they do, providers lose margin.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the industry need for better insight on how to quickly and efficiently improve patient experiences.  Surveys which are the norm in health care fail to deliver service failure details.  The company's software goes beyond current text analysis solutions by automating the classification of patient feedback based on the ideas and sentiment expressed by patients. These results are converted into precise analytics and displayed in dashboards so front-line managers can quickly identify problems and make rapid improvements in patient experiences.  Previously the company demonstrated the technical feasibility of its software by focusing on a narrow set of providers.  This research will refine the software so that it is capable of analyzing patient feedback across a wide range of health care organizations. What operational changes will have the greatest, positive impact on patient loyalty and market share?  Results from this project will answer that question for a broad range of health care organizations.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be an instrument that alleviates several
    current difficulties in the growth measurement of many microbes, especially anaerobic
    and other fastidious organisms. A large number of these species are naturally
    occurring in the human body, and have recently been shown to play critical roles
    in allergies, autoimmune diseases, dietary health, cancer, infection response,
    and more. The study of these species is considered by many to be the next frontier
    of modern medicine, especially as current approaches to managing infectious diseases,
    such as traditional antibiotics, appear to be losing effectiveness. However, current
    measurement technology is largely incompatible with the specialized environments
    and chambers in which anaerobic organisms must be grown. There is a large unmet
    need for better ways to measure anaerobic bacterial growth; this need is growing
    quickly as interest in the field increases. The ability to conduct high-throughput
    experiments in specialized environments will become critical as research into
    various human microbiomes accelerates, and demand for high-volume data grows.
    The existing market for high-throughput measurement devices is at least $300 million
    and growing.  This platform will allow for systematic studies of cell culture
    growth that can be accomplished easily and economically. \n\nThis SBIR Phase II
    project proposes to develop and refine a miniaturized multi-well plate reader
    that measures optical characteristics of up to 96 cell samples for measuring growth
    of many microbial samples simultaneously. The continuing rise of systems and computational
    biology demonstrates a growing demand for large amounts of quantitative data,
    and the variety of microbes relevant to the human body necessitates such an approach.
    However, these measurement techniques are not universally accessible due to current
    instruments' complexity, size, and cost. This project will continue development
    of a miniature, simplified version of a device called a multi-well plate reader,
    expanding the availability of parallel growth measurement (and other metrics)
    to a wider array of researchers and environments. The first goal is to simplify
    the instrument's electronics, add an on-board display for clarity, and allow battery-powered
    operation. The next goal is to accelerate equilibration to any surrounding environment
    to allow proper functioning even in extreme conditions, by measuring a wide array
    of environmental variables at different points in space and time. The third goal
    is to solidify the device's mechanical aspects for reliability and stability in
    a shaker. Finally, this project will support the development of a fully-functional
    wireless interface for control and data management, allowing effective remote
    use in any environment.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has

    Sepsis is a poorly understood clinical syndrome and is characterized by a dysregulation of the immune system?s response to infection. It is the leading cause of death and is the most expensive condition treated in U.S. hospitals, exerting a $20.3 billion burden annually, 5.2% of total costs to the healthcare system nationwide. Sepsis is highly time critical and every 1-hour delay in antibiotics is associated with a 3-7% increase in the odds of a poor outcome. There is currently a dire need for a tool that can quickly assess if a patient is at risk for sepsis. Such a tool would ideally gather any relevant information very quickly and provide a probability of sepsis directly back to the physician in less than 30 minutes. If this tool were available, a lot of the uncertainty revolving around early sepsis screening could be minimized. Outcomes such as mortality, readmission rate, length of stay, length of ICU stay, hospital cost, and compliance to Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Core Measures could all be improved by such a tool.

    The goal of the SBIR Phase I project was to establish the feasibility of a point of care sensor that can measure cells and proteins from a drop of blood for the eventual stratification of sepsis. In Phase II, work will continue with our manufacturing partners to design, optimize, and test a one-time-use cartridge and a portable reader for the simultaneous measurement of cells and proteins from a small volume of blood. The objective will be to develop a scalable technology platform, that can measure total white blood cell count, CD64 expression on neutrophils, and 2 proteins (IL-6, and PCT), simultaneously from the same drop of blood, and also be able to measure different proteins by changing the types of beads used in the assay. The goal is to allow physicians and healthcare providers to perform frequent measurements at the point of care, and to integrate the clinical and biological data to predict sepsis and organ dysfunction. The result of this project will be a fully functional reader and accompanying disposable cartridges for the measurement of these critical sepsis biomarkers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from group chat technology that enables knowledge workers to collaborate more effectively than ever before. It is the first tool built that empowers users to efficiently carry out both real-time and asynchronous conversations in the same system, with each user reading only those conversations that are important to him or her. In particular, the technology empowers teams to make decisions in virtual meetings that take place asynchronously over periods of hours or days. This is in contrast with existing group chat technology, where conversations usually end as soon as someone starts talking about something else. This ability to conduct long running, virtual meetings is invaluable for large teams that need to coordinate work across different locations and time zones. Large, distributed teams are fast becoming the norm for how organizations operate, as instant communication and globalization make such teams the workforce of the future. Coordinating the efforts of such teams is a huge pain point for companies, and this technology is a leap in the state of the art in this space.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project has three major research objectives: scaling the technology to teams of 10,000+ people; faithfully translating the user experience to mobile devices; and developing techniques for serving the needs of diverse deployments large and small. For scalability, one major area is "presence", telling each user who else is currently online. Presence data naturally grows with the number of pairs of users, therefore much faster than the number of users, and the company will need to develop algorithms to focus presence on significant connections between users. Among the unique challenges on mobile, the often-limited Internet connectivity demands algorithms that remember data previously fetched from the server to avoid asking for it again, carefully balanced with getting needed updates to never show out-of-date information to the user; the immediacy required for a great chat experience makes both horns of this dilemma especially sharp. Serving diverse deployments demands techniques for making software updates routine and seamless, a practice recently popularized in browsers and mobile apps but rarely accomplished to date in distributing server applications such as that described here.

    This SBIR Phase II project focuses on advancing the domestic manufacturing capabilities for high-value nanomaterials for new membrane materials. Previously, the company has developed a novel membrane material with considerable economic, environmental, and nutritional impact in industrial process applications. Commercially available nanofiltration (NF) membrane systems employ polymer membranes, which have inherent chemical and thermal intolerance and are therefore difficult to clean or cannot be used in all separation streams. Meanwhile, 12% of US energy consumption is dedicated to thermal separations, a number that can be cut by a factor of 10 with appropriate physical separation technologies. This technology has applications across food & beverage processing, pharmaceutical production, semiconductor manufacturing, and chemical/petrochemical refining.

    Creating nanometer-scale features on large areas (tens of square meters) will enable technical opportunities for a multitude of products and applications. In this SBIR Phase II project, the company is conducting process development, pilot demonstration, and scale up efforts toward coating graphene oxide thin films for nanofiltration membrane separations applications. Today?s membrane processes are limited by the selectivity and durability of the nanofiltration membrane. Improved selectivity and operational conditions from the material platform enables improved downstream processes, and new product development. The technology is tolerant to elevated temperatures, extreme pH, organic and chlorinated solvents, and high levels of oxidizers. Transitioning from thermal separations to membrane separations saves 90% of the required energy. Meanwhile, payback time is < 3 months when improving clean-in-place (CIP) protocol for existing NF processes. This is a game changer for the separations industry. Key separations of interest include desalting, whey concentration, sugar fractionation, fatty acid separation, nutraceutical extraction, pharmaceutical purification and black liquor concentration.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result in a significant improvement in the performance, power, and cost of deploying machine learning (ML) solutions through horizontal platform technologies that enable many vertical applications. This improvement will accelerate deployment of intelligent systems and improve scalability through localized intelligence. Our technology automates hardware design, implementation, and deployment to Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platforms. Our initial target verticals: Security and Surveillance, Predictive Maintenance, and Healthcare represent hundreds of billions USD in growth markets for IoT devices and substantially more economic impact through improved efficiency in deployment and operations and reduced societal costs. Improved performance, power consumption and scalability of these key technologies will lead to improved public safety, improved intelligence in home healthcare services, and more efficient manufacturing and energy systems through deployment of Predictive Maintenance technologies on key industrial equipment. Wide deployment of these technologies will lead to substantial energy savings and a corresponding reduction in carbon emissions, reduced economic loss due to negative events, improved scalability and response time to predicted or active negative events, and lower cost in deployment and operations due to low cost, low power, and physically small sensor systems.

    The proposed project focuses on design of high performance, energy-efficient platforms for ML applications, and associated design tools and libraries. Neural networks are heavily used for many machine learning problems but optimizing for efficient deployment currently requires extensive trial-and-error for the large design space of options. Our deep neural network (DNN) optimization framework applies bit-width optimizations, weight sharing and pruning automatically to reduce computation and weight storage demands by more than 10X, while analyzing quality of results impact and using fine-tuned retraining to minimize or eliminate accuracy degradation. Our high level synthesis (HLS) tool then translates optimized networks to hardware while applying pipelining, functional unit parallelism, resource sharing, and platform-specific optimizations. Together these tools automate and accelerate the process of analyzing, optimizing and implementing ML for hardware deployment, reducing time and required expertise for hardware design. Our deployment platforms are modular, composable platforms for small, low-cost deployments of audio/video signal processing, feature extraction and classification, systems control (e.g. pan-tilt-zoom cameras), and communications to decision-making or cloud services. We will extend competitive advantages from our Phase I project with features for solutions in the security/surveillance, predictive maintenance, and healthcare verticals, and tight integration of platforms, tools and IP libraries.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enhance precision medicine by reducing data processing time and cost, leading to faster results, higher genomic data processing throughput and, ultimately leading to better treatment of patients. Many diseases have their impacts locked in DNA data. Unlocking the data for an individual may provide a significant boost to human healthcare. By providing Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data analysis in one hour, as compared to the current standard of several days, and at a fraction of today's cost, DNA tests can become mainstream and research can be accelerated. WGS data is becoming a key component in ensuring correct and timely treatment of vulnerable populations, including newborn babies, people with cancer and rare diseases, and pregnant women. Correct prediction and treatment based on WGS data will extend human lives and promote better quality of life by accelerating the development and broad implementation of precision medicine.

    The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is to develop a cloud-based framework to accelerate whole genome sequencing data analysis.  This SBIR Phase II project creates a software framework where multiple industry-standard genomic analyses will be accelerated transparently to run orders of magnitude faster, while reducing computational costs by up to 4x. The proposed innovation solves the scaling, performance, and cost challenges of WGS computing through novel parallelism extraction and mapping techniques. The framework under development for accelerating genomic analysis has been implemented to focus on GPUs and traditional processors (CPUs). Using this framework, secondary data analysis programs can use all the computing resources present in a standard computing node (CPU cores; GPUs), leading to higher utilization of the system and higher throughput. The GPU accelerates the data parallel portion of the software, while the CPU is mainly responsible for the orchestration of data between CPUs and GPUs, load balancing across multiple accelerators. By providing this framework to run on the cloud and on-premise, users can scale to meet the exploding demands of the DNA analysis industry. The software generates exact results to industry standard tools and does not sacrifice configurability that is critical for users. This framework also will enable researchers and medical professionals to analyze several thousands of genomes simultaneously, leading to higher quality results.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to create an economical, light&#8208;weight,
    high performance Terahertz (THz) spectrometer to allow testing of air and fossil

    is capable of characterizing the different molecules and chemicals in a gas sample.
    Historically these spectrometers have been relegated to the laboratory because
    of their size and complexity but recent technical advancements have made it possible
    to build a spectroscopic THz sensor small enough and light enough to be flown
    on a consumer drone. The reductions in size and cost have opened the door to using
    THz sensors for emissions testing of ships entering U.S. waters or contaminant
    testing of fossil fuels at petroleum processing facilities. This is significant
    because the ability to analyze samples locally removes the time and expense of
    collecting and shipping potentially dangerous compounds (i.e. flammable compounds
    or pollutants) to a laboratory for analysis. It also allows detection and classification
    to occur on short notice and without the need to subject personnel to the local
    environment. \n\nThe proposed project will produce the first article of a compact,
    battery operated, autonomously operating spectroscopic THz sensor capable of mixed
    gas analysis to parts per million sensitivities. It will be constructed predominantly
    from economical off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf fiber optic components in a novel highly

    photomixers, a folded, light&#8208;weight, carbon fiber sample cell incorporating
    patented 3D printed mirror technology and a patented optical phase&#8208;modulation
    technique that removes the effects of coherent detection. The instrument will
    first be employed for laboratory based measurements of sulfur-containing contaminants
    in gas flows. Upon the successful demonstration of the capabilities of the instrument,
    a first article will be used in initial testing and collaborative field work.
    Sales of a larger laboratory instrument based on the same technology will begin

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will transform how alcohol use disorders (AUDs)
    are diagnosed, monitored, and treated by the further development of a micro-biosensor
    system for health care providers.  An implantable micro-biosensor that reliably
    detects, monitors, and tracks alcohol consumption allows for more accurate diagnosis
    so the appropriate treatment solution can be prescribed and tracked. Our system
    integrates an implantable micro-biosensor with smartphone technology to continuously
    detect and monitor, collect, transmit, store, and analyze relevant biodata, pushing
    resulting behavior change instructions to the user.  This creates a revolutionary
    approach to the diagnosis and treatment of alcohol use disorders by reporting
    outcome data more accurately and reliably than current, self-reporting methods.
    Our system potentially yields multiple societal benefits, including lower treatment
    costs and increased treatment accessibility. Additionally, it could reduce both
    economic and social costs through the identification of people at risk thereby
    increasing the number of people who seek and receive treatment.  \n\nThis Small
    Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will focus on refining the
    design and functionalization of an injectable alcohol micro-biosensor, developing
    a wearable device, and testing the alcohol micro-biosensor in animals. Once fully
    developed, our system for detecting, monitoring, and treating alcohol use disorders
    will consist of three components: 1) a multi-plex micro-biosensor, small enough
    to be directly injected under the skin. The sensor is customizable to continuously
    monitor and measure alcohol; 2) a wearable sensor device that provides power to
    the injected micro-biosensor while collecting the measured data to transmit to
    a nearby smartphone or other data aggregator; and 3) a mobile smartphone application
    developed by our company that uses evidence-based psychotherapy techniques to
    encourage behavior modification. The anticipated technical results include an
    implantable micro-biosensor for the continuous monitoring and measuring of alcohol
    consumption. Additionally, an unobtrusive wearable device that can power the biosensor
    and store and transmit the data collected is anticipated. Both of these components
    will have been tested in animals and be ready to move on to testing in humans.\n\nThis

    This STTR Phase II project will focus on the development of cost effective, high temperature molten salt heat transfer fluids for third generation concentrated solar power (CSP) plants with operating temperatures >700?C. In the Phase I of this research, an additive package was developed that formed an adherent ceramic oxide coating on 316/316L stainless steel at the temperatures >700?C when added to specific chloride salt blends and inhibit corrosion. The utilization of the inhibitor package strategy will enable the utilization of economical stainless-steel alloys in the CSP plants and would reduce the infra-structure cost. Such solutions will have a direct impact on the renewable energy market which would help to lower the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) for thermal solar from the current cost of 12?/kwh to the target 3?/kwh by 2030. The scientific and technological insight gained in this project could be beneficial to many other applications, such as molten carbonate fuel cells, thermal energy storage systems, nuclear molten fluoride/chloride reactors, and other high-temperature systems that are susceptible to aggressive corrosion. Incorporation of the inhibited molten chloride salt in the CSP plants will also provide sustainable green energy, reduce water usage, create more jobs and offer U.S. energy independence and security. On a societal level, impact will be achieved by the continued delivery and development of educational activities based on the research topics embodied by this work.


    The core innovation in this proposed program is the development of a chemical mixture, an additive package that would minimize the corrosion of stainless steel induced by molten chloride salts at temperatures >700?C. The additive package reacts with the stainless steel and forms a corrosion inhibiting ceramic oxide coating in-situ when added to the molten chlorides at operating temperatures>700?C. The chloride salts are proposed to be the heat transfer fluids for third generation CSP plants. The feasibility of the inhibitor package strategy in a real world CSP plant will be critically assessed in this proposed research. A prototype bench scale molten test loop will be designed and built to mimic the flow conditions in a CSP plant. The effect of prolonged exposure to high temperature molten salts on the mechanical properties of the base metal under dynamic conditions will be studied with attention to the molten salt induced degradation of strength and toughness at elevated temperatures. The degradation behavior of the salt with the inhibitor package will be studied as well. Additional research will be performed to gain fundamental insight on the nucleation and growth of the ceramic oxide coating and its thermal and mechanical stability in dynamic flow conditions.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to transform intravenous (IV) infusions of biologic medicines into simple subcutaneous (SC) injections. Biologics have improved the treatment of human disease. Unfortunately, their delivery is burdensome. The standard of administration of these biologics is often by IV infusion at low concentrations, which can take multiple hours to deliver, cause patient discomfort, and increase the risk of infection. Although SC injection is preferred, constraints on SC volume (1.5-2.0 mL) would necessitate concentrations much greater than 100 mg/mL, which are often unfeasible. Solutions at concentrations exceeding 100 mg/mL are highly viscous (honey-like), making them difficult to inject and leading to unstable products. This project's microparticle suspension technology can deliver high concentrations while fully preserving the protein structure, function, and efficacy. Transforming the delivery of biologics offers advantages to patients, healthcare providers, payers, and biopharmaceutical companies. Patients will experience less pain and discomfort, save time, have fewer infections, and have better access to biologics. Healthcare providers will be able to process more patients, decrease the chance of complications, and use fewer human resources. Payers will have decreased reimbursement costs. Biopharmaceutical companies will have patented product differentiation and the ability to develop otherwise intractable biologics.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop a soft atomization manufacturing platform for the production of microparticle suspensions capable of transforming intravenous (IV) infusions of biologics into simple subcutaneous (SC) injections. The standard of administration of biologics is intravenous infusion at low concentrations, which can take hours to deliver, cause patient discomfort, and increase the risk of infection. Although SC injection is preferred, constraints on SC volume (1.5-2.0 mL) necessitate concentrations greater than 100 mg/mL, which are often unfeasible. Solutions at concentrations exceeding 100 mg/mL are highly viscous (honey-like), making them difficult to inject and leading to unstable products. This project's gently processed microparticle suspensions can deliver high concentrations while preserving protein structure and bioactivity, an accomplishment not well-demonstrated with other microparticle technologies. This project aims to advance the readiness level of the innovation by performing process calibration of a bench-scale system, followed by developing and characterizing the resulting particles and suspensions produced on that system. With well-formulated suspensions, in vivo pharmacokinetic and efficacy studies will commence. The project will support the development of manufacturing capabilities towards a goal of transitioning to pilot-scale production. This project aims to offer advantages to patients, healthcare providers, payers, and biopharmaceutical companies.

    This SBIR Phase II project focuses on creating scalable Virtual Learning Assistant technology for automatic educational assessments using open response questions. Educational researchers and experts believe that the best pedagogies responsible for improving students' learning outcomes involve (i) open response questions assessments and (ii) one-to-one instructional tutoring. Students learn better when they are given an opportunity to construct answers in their own words instead of selecting from multiple choices and when they receive immediate guidance and coaching. However, these two pedagogies are very time consuming and expensive to implement, making them very difficult to scale. The proposed project will apply the most advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing to solve both these problems. Students will benefit from the interactive formative assessment that engages them in a natural language conversation. This innovation is applicable across the grade levels in K-12, higher education, and adult learning and across the subject areas including the sciences. It will facilitate implementation of more rigorous academic standards and make online education more effective. This innovation will improve students' learning outcomes, save teachers' time and reduce the cost of delivering high quality engaging education at a large scale.

    This project will create a new type of virtual assistant technology that is exclusively focused on education. The proposed Virtual Learning Assistant (VLA) will advance the conversational AI technology to create pedagogically rich learning and assessment environments for any topic in a content area. The VLA is uniquely distinct from general purpose virtual assistants in its ability to evaluate an open response answer instead of merely serving information. This project will investigate and create various algorithms for processing natural language input arising in an educational setting across different subjects or topics. The resulting mobile and web based product will allow teachers to create new high-quality assessment items with minimal input and assign them to their students. When a student answers a question, the VLA will analyze it instantly for linguistic syntax and semantics using statistical and deterministic knowledge representations. The VLA will generate not only a numerical score reflecting the accuracy of the answer, but also a qualitative feedback that will guide the student towards conceptual mastery of the topic. As part of this Phase II research, a pilot study will be conducted each year involving teachers and students to study the efficacy of the VLA and its scalability.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to provide a solution to the problem of drinking water contamination by developing an advanced adsorbent for point-of-use/home filtration applications. Micropollutants, pharmaceutical residues, pesticides, industrial chemicals and other organic compounds present in water resources at trace concentrations of one part per billion and less, are recognized as a major factor of contamination. Consumers around the world no longer trust the safety of their drinking water due to the presence of micropollutants and other contaminants. These compounds are pervasive and can present toxicity at trace concentrations. As a result, consumers have significantly increased the non-sustainable use of plastic bottled water, now a $260 billion market. Current point-of-use filtration products are primarily designed to improve taste and odor, and are generally ineffective in removing micropollutants. CycloPure's technology has been developed specifically to target and remove micropollutants from water. This project focuses on the further development of the company's cyclodextrin adsorbent to improve the effectiveness of point-of-use filters. This material can be used as a drop-in replacement without changes in filter design. CycloPure's materials will allow households to safely use readily available tap water.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to identify strategies to develop a suitable form factor to incorporate CycloPure's high-affinity cyclodextrin adsorbent into point-of-use filters. The company's adsorbent is formed by reacting cyclodextrins, which are derived from corn starch, with readily available monomers in a single step process. During the Phase I period of this project, scalable reaction conditions were identified for production of the adsorbent in powder form. Flow-through applications, such as gravity filters, frequently require granular particles to achieve desired flow rates. Early activities will focus on the preparation of the adsorbent in granular form to demonstrate scalability and retention of removal performance similar to powder form. Thereafter, column studies will be performed in order to assess the removal performance of granular media under flow-through conditions at environmentally relevant micropollutant concentrations. Following identification of adsorption characteristics and appropriate flow conditions, a prototype point-of-use filter will be constructed and tested for the removal of micropollutants from tap water using advanced analytical techniques, including a combination of target and non-target screening approaches.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will continue development of cutting-edge nanopore technology that will greatly enhance biological preservation of regenerative medicines such as stem cells, complex tissues, and organs. Such a technology has the potential to greatly improve the biobanking and transport infrastructure of healthcare for on-demand cells and tissues, improved mass trauma care and advanced personalized medical procedures. Biopreservation is required in regenerative medicine at nearly all levels in the acquisition of source material, isolation, storage and shipment of a final product to patient. Yet critically, the field lacks the ability to safely and efficiently preserve these tissues and medicines while maintaining high cell viability and function after cryopreservation, severely limiting product shelf life. Nowhere is the absence of a biobanking technology more palpable than organ transplantation, where the time window between donor and recipient (4-7 hours) is not enough to properly match donations, screen for pathogens, or transport long distances. Enabling the United States to safely bank organs at subzero temperature will significantly enhance national healthcare. The US faces strong commercial and competitiveness reasons to invest in all facets of regenerative medicine, including organ therapies. Cryopreservation solutions would indirectly enable significant savings to the healthcare system, the patient, and healthcare insurance companies with the cost savings from regenerative medicine treatments estimated to be nearly $250 billion per year in the U.S.



    The cytotoxicity of current biopreservation techniques is largely associated with inefficient cryoprotective agent and water delivery across the cell membrane during cooling leading to irreparable cell damage from ice formation. Phase I established a fundamentally different approach to cryoprotective agent (CPA) optimization by developing first-in-the-field bioinspired nanopores as transmembrane mega highways to facilitate safe and efficient intracellular delivery and removal of cryoprotective agents during cryopreservation and dramatically increase post-thaw cell yield, viability, and function. The pore-formers assist CPA loading at reduced temperatures to make up the functional loss of biological protein channels at cold temperatures, reduce the amount of CPA required to remarkably low concentrations, and expand the selectable range of CPAs, all while dynamically dissociating at physiological temperature to prevent open-pore toxicity. Further R&D effort will diversify molecular design, optimize lead molecules, scale-up production, and perform cryopreservation studies on regenerative medicines of major therapeutic significance such as stem cells and complex tissues.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to engineer loblolly pine to increase wood density (yield) by 20% with no additional land, water, or fertilizer use requirements.  With global demand for wood products expected to rise 60% by 2060, managed pine plantations will play a key role in helping to meet this need. By identifying and studying the genes that control plant development, particularly as they relate to cellulose (wood) production in the cell wall, the tree's natural ability to capture and utilize carbon dioxide (CO2) for more wood growth has been enhanced through genetic engineering. This technology will strengthen the United States' position as the leading producer and exporter of commercial wood products, i.e., pulpwood for paper, sawtimber for lumber, and wood pellets for fuel. Additionally, with advancements in the understanding of the pine genome, the work proposed here will stimulate the development of novel innovations in the field of forest genetics while the proposed genetically engineered seedlings help to address growing industry needs for commercial wood products.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a more efficient approach to engineering high wood density loblolly pine varieties. In contrast to traditional breeding, which has seen a modest 6% increase in wood density improvements over the past 20 years, this work proposes to increase wood density in pine by 20% through application of a directed, "gene trait" method to genetically engineer loblolly pine by altering secondary cell wall gene regulation. The proposed research will utilize a newly improved pine transformation protocol to scale up prototype production of tree seedlings designed with patent-pending, cell wall gene platform technologies. Also, this work establishes a pine engineering pipeline using germplasm adapted to different selective environments. This will streamline the production process while allowing for faster testing and development of technologies that improve growth traits in multiple growing regions. Specifically, plants engineered with this method will be tested for their long-term wood quality characteristics in both greenhouse and field trials. The goal of this project is to establish a commercial scale production program for loblolly pine engineered seedlings, and prepare for field testing and ultimately commercial sales of the cell wall platform technologies that have been developed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be substantial: a successful project would transform the construction industry, making it far more efficient by reducing legal conflicts, schedule slips and poor decision making. The proposed work will enable the fast and easy creation of 100% complete visual documentation of a physical space; this documentation can be generated many times throughout the course of construction. In so doing, the proposed project will allow professionals in the construction industry to track progress and communicate with their teams far more efficiently than ever before. A second outcome of the project will be the creation of vast, detailed, never before seen datasets of construction projects and real estate, allowing technical innovations in artificial intelligence and computer vision to impact one of the largest industries in the nation and the world. For example, systems could be trained to automatically spot safety concerns, augmenting the efforts of safety managers and keeping workers safer than ever before.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a fast, easy to use and cheap method to create photorealistic immersive models using off the shelf consumer hardware. Technical hurdles include validating the quality and efficacy of models generated with consumer hardware and automatic creation of routes through the 3D space without human annotation. Technical milestones involve using various sensor streams as well as other prior data to build these routes. With these hurdles cleared, advanced work may include automated analytics between and among 3D models of the same site captured over time. Because of the system's ease of use, it will enable the collection of large, totally novel datasets. The goal of the research is to produce a prototype that a layperson can use to create an immersive model of a physical site in order to document it with no annotation effort. The plan to reach these goals includes iterative software development against the hurdles listed above, as well as continuous user feedback to guide and refine development.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop an instrument platform that will facilitate development and translation of next generation diagnostics and therapeutics that are based on a class of nanovesicles called extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs, which are nanoparticles shed by cells, are being investigated for early detection of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders, from biofluids without the need of invasive tissue biopsies. The lack of tools and techniques to perform high-throughput characterization of EVs is limiting translation. The platform under development will enable an understanding EVs produced by cells. The global market for nanoparticle analysis instrumentation in the life sciences is estimated at $5.9 Billion. The EV market, which is a subset of this market, is rapidly growing, with a predicted compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 47.3% over the next five years. Biological nanoparticles are playing an increasing role in life science applications and better, target-specific, faster tools are needed to characterize them in a high-throughput way.

    This SBIR Phase II project will complete the development of an instrument platform to enable Extracellular Vesicle (EV) measurements and characterization.  The platform will include a customer configurable consumable, eliminating the requirement for an expensive custom robotic arrayer step, removing barriers to end-user adoption and decentralizing discovery. Also, long-term shelf-life of the consumable will be established. In addition, improvements into the imaging platform will enable visualization of the smallest nanoparticles, relaxing the complexity and cost of the platform and providing a functional advantage over competitive offerings. The platform will automate much of the workflow, reducing operator hands-on time. The resulting platform will enable EV measurements with 5X-to-30X less sample volume, detect 100X-to-10,000X less concentrated targets, and increase throughput by using a workflow that bypasses purification requirements needed by other techniques. The completion of these objectives will result in a life science research tool for researchers and industry working on EV-based diagnostics and therapeutics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a fluidic platform for selective bacterial and endotoxin removal from blood. This technology can potentially serve as a novel blood cleansing therapeutic for diseases such as sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening complication caused by infection. In the U.S., sepsis afflicts over 1.6 million annually and has an associated mortality rate ranging from 25-50%. Realization of this fluidic platform technology will address the broader societal needs of inhibiting sepsis progression and developing more specific and effective therapeutics for the treatment of human disease. Commercialization and implementation of the proposed innovation may reduce the hospital length of stay associated with sepsis, decrease sepsis morbidity and mortality rates, and potentially reduce the annual U.S. expenditure for sepsis. Scientific and technological understanding generated by this work has additional applications for other blood-borne diseases, such as HIV, leukemia, and Lyme disease. Ultimately, this technology will revolutionize life science research through inertial-based fluidic platform use, enabling new discoveries in cell/particle focusing phenomena and interactions that have profound implications for elucidating inertial focusing mechanisms and for the development of novel platform technologies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes a novel approach to address the problem of sepsis through the direct removal of pathogens and associated toxins from circulation. Sepsis is the leading cause of death of the critically ill in the United States, costing over $24 Billion in treatment annually. The primary treatment for sepsis is system antibiotic administration, which is failing due to the rise of drug resistance and new, emerging pathogens. The research objectives of this project will result in an easy to use, efficient, and cost-effective fluidic platform for separation and removal of bacteria and associated toxins from circulation. This will facilitate the broad use of inertial-based fluidic platforms as research tools and for clinical applications, such as sepsis. The proposed research will 1) optimize fluidic platform design for clinical application, economical use, and workflow efficiency, 2) demonstrate efficient fluidic platform-mediated bacteria and endotoxin capture, and 3) confirm the biological benefits of the fluidic platform technology using a validated animal model of sepsis. Successful completion of these studies will demonstrate the positive biological consequences of direct pathogen and toxin removal from circulation and establish the commercial viability of the fluidic platform technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to advance the use of engineered cell-based therapeutics in the human gut through the development of technologies for the reliable and reversible colonization of the gut with therapeutic bacterial strains. Engineered cellular therapeutics are poised to become the next major driver of pharmaceutical innovation due to their potential for sophisticated behavior and modular design. The gut is an ideal entry point for deploying engineered therapeutic cells, as it serves as our body's natural interface with foreign genetic material. A key impediment to bacterial drug development for the gut is the lack of strategies for achieving predictable colonization across the wide range of gut environments that patients can harbor. Furthermore, tools for on-demand clearance of therapeutic strains to ensure safety do not currently exist. The proposed innovation will overcome these challenges and allow the potential of engineered bacterial cells as therapies to be fully realized.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop the technologies necessary to achieve predictable colonization of, and targeted clearance from, the human gut by engineered bacterial strains. Predictable colonization will be achieved through the use of a therapeutic strain that has been modified to consume a privileged prebiotic substrate that can be dosed alongside the strain to precisely control its abundance by giving it a competitive advantage. To ensure containment and enable targeted clearance, the therapeutic strain will be further modified such that it only can grow in environments where the prebiotic is present. This will allow for the generation of a robust synthetic niche within the gut that can be manipulated solely through the administration of this prebiotic control molecule. In addition, to enable the commercial deployment of these novel technologies, manufacturing protocols will be developed to ensure that a fully integrated therapeutic strain can be produced in sufficient quantities and stably formulated.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop engineered brewer's yeast to produce hop flavor compounds during beer fermentation, so as to replace the need for agriculturally produced hops.  Using agriculturally produced hops as a flavor component poses several challenges: 1) hops farming is natural resource intensive, 2) flavors imparted by hops are inconsistent from batch-to-batch, 3) lengthy agriculture timelines decouple demand from supply, and 4) new flavor varieties are restricted by slow and capital intensive hops breeding programs. This project establishes a product development framework for engineering brewer's yeast to produce flavor compounds during fermentation that are matched to consumer preferences. The technology developed during this project will allow for sustainable, consistent, on-demand production of hop flavors, and, in addition, may be extended to additional flavors and other fermentable products.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop engineered brewer's yeast for production of flavor compounds that are ordinarily derived from hops. At present, the beer industry relies on agriculturally produced hops to impart organoleptically rich flavors and character to beer. Engineered yeast strains will serve as a drop-in replacement for conventional brewing strains, in that they both ferment beer and produce flavor compounds at concentrations desired in the finished beer. By applying an agile development framework towards yeast strain development, new brewer's yeast strains will be generated that produce flavor bouquets preferred by brewers and consumers. Genes that encode biosynthetic pathways for production of flavor compounds will be incorporated into brewer's yeast, and various gene regulatory programs will be tested that give rise to myriad flavor bouquets in finished beer. Strains will be initially evaluated in small-scale micro-aerobic fermentations and analyzed by GC/MS to screen for relevant flavor compound concentrations. Based on screening results, strains with desired target flavor compound concentrations will be used to produce beer at industrial pilot scale for evaluation by sensory analysis panels as a means of generating consumer feedback. This workflow will be deployed in an iterative fashion to optimize the performance of the hops flavor-producing brewer's yeast.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to allow more consumers to make use of assisted and autonomous driving systems in automobiles. Fully Autonomous Vehicles (AV) will reduce traffic collisions and enable humans to spend less time driving and more time on productive activities. Commercially deploying AVs requires a number of key technologies including sensing, perceptual systems, motion planning, and actuation. Our discussions with leaders and decisionmakers at automotive companies have shown that the development of robust, accurate, and energy-efficient perception systems is a major technical obstacle to creating mass-producible autonomous road vehicles. Of particular interest to automakers is scaling down the computational requirements of perceptual systems while preserving high levels of accuracy and robustness.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will use deep learning to create perception systems that are (a) scalable across different computational platforms and (b) scalable across smaller or larger sensor sets. Specifically, the company will develop scalable systems from small compute platforms (used for Highly Automated Driving) to somewhat larger compute platforms (used for Fully Automated Driving). Further, the company will develop perceptual systems that scale from few sensors to many sensors. The goal is to "do more with less," advancing the pareto-optimal frontier of efficiency-accuracy and price-accuracy tradeoffs. The company has already engaged with automotive OEMs and suppliers to develop partnerships and to define metrics for success in this endeavor.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies in its potential to develop a new mechanism for painlessly terminating atrial fibrillation.  Cardiac arrhythmia is one of the leading causes of death and debilitation.  A common means of terminating harmful rhythms is delivering a shock via an external or implantable defibrillator.  The pain from the shock is the number one concern for patients with implantable defibrillators, and because of the pain, an implantable option is not practical for atrial fibrillation.  The high-risk, high-reward research to be conducted under this project will significantly advance the field of defibrillation therapy and aims to lead to the introduction of a new class of implantable medical device technology.

    The proposed project seeks to develop and evaluate an implantable device that achieves non-destructive temporary conduction delay in cardiac tissues for the painless termination, and potentially prevention, of life threatening arrhythmias.  Cardiac arrhythmias are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed world. More than 1,000 Americans die each day from sudden cardiac arrest.  The team intends to initially target the development of a device to achieve rapid and painless termination of life threatening arrhythmias to treat atrial fibrillation. The successful development of the proposed device has the potential to benefit millions of patients.  Additionally, by virtue of its painless modulation of arrhythmogenesis, the proposed device may well also terminate incipient arrhythmias.  The phase II project will develop and evaluate a prototype system.  It is anticipated that the project will result in a new implantable medical device that painlessly terminates atrial fibrillation.

    The proposed project centers around further development on the world's smallest 2-way communications satellites and associated ground hardware. Key contributions of this project include system and networking optimization and validation of the technology through end to end demonstrations. The system optimization component will involve the development of system-level models that capture the complex interaction of all elements, including dynamics, constraints, and objectives. The network optimization component will focus on the development of algorithms that enable seamless communications scheduling as the network scales to several thousand devices on the ground.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project spans commercial, scientific and humanitarian applications by extending IoT (Internet of Things) connectivity to remote regions without cell coverage and where satellite data is prohibitively expensive for vital applications including agriculture, energy, shipping, and weather. The satellites and ground hardware being developed in this SBIR Phase II project have been driven towards miniaturization and power reduction to enable a broader range of customers to take advantage of the network by allowing easy integration into their devices and easy-to-install autonomous ground solutions.  The unique launch economics afforded by the miniaturized satellites enable IoT (Internet of Things) sensing and data return at a cost 1/10th to 1/100th that of incumbent satellite data providers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to extend the function of windows by turning them into daytime sources of electricity. The target market for this technology is tall buildings in urban areas, where electricity demand is the highest and the available space for installing solar cells is smallest. This technology utilizes a window tint that can absorb sunlight and remit light of a certain color through the window's glass to small solar cells located at the edges. This technology hasn't been commercialized previously because most tint materials typically absorb their own emitted light, limiting efficiency. This project will provide a novel solution to these problems with a low-cost window tint material made from quantum dots. The work conducted in this project focuses on scaling up prototypes and optimization for cost and reliability. With this technology, tall buildings will approach net-zero energy consumption or even supply electricity to the grid. This would reduce the city's carbon footprint as well as save money for the companies/individuals occupying these buildings, which would increase their prosperity and welfare. This technology would also reduce pollution by limiting the amount of burned fossil fuels needed to generate electricity. 

    The proposed project develops and scales up the electricity-generating window prototypes to the square meter size, validates long-term reliability, optimizes for manufacturing, and launches pilot projects. The technology is based on luminescent solar concentrators, which are made by tinting a window with a fluorophore material that partially absorbs sunlight and then converts it to fluorescence, preferably in the near-infrared. The fluorescence is trapped inside the window by total internal reflection and is concentrated to the edges where small solar cells efficiently convert that light into electricity. Utilizing this technology in windows to generate electricity has not been commercialized due to unsuitable fluorophores. The fluorophore used in this project are quantum dots composed of CuInSeS/ZnS, which solves the problems of previous materials. Traditional fluorophores like dyes typically have strong self-absorption, narrow spectral absorption, and poor stability. Quantum dots are more stable, but are expensive, sometimes toxic (due to heavy metals), and also suffer from self-absorption. The breakthrough in CuInSeS/ZnS quantum dots is that they are significantly cheaper, avoid toxic elements, have near-infrared fluorescence optimal for low-cost commercial solar cells, and do not self-absorb. At the conclusion of the phase II project, prototype products will be installed in at least one building.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will be to develop a new tool to safely and nondestructively deliver genes and other materials into large numbers cells at the same time. New forms of therapies for cancer and other intractable diseases take advantage of a patient's own cells, re-engineered in the laboratory to target a tumor or other diseased tissue. However, generating these cells is currently inefficient, slow, and expensive. Patient-derived cells resist transfection using standard non-viral biochemical approaches of lipid delivery systems, cell-penetrating peptides, and high-voltage electroporation, requiring an engineering alternative. The proposed technology provides a safe, turnkey, and scalable technology with a potential transformative impact in research and life sciences laboratories and companies, representing a high-growth and high-value market opportunity.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes a new nanomaterial delivery system to introduce reprogramming agents into immune cells efficiently and with low cell toxicity. This project will examine how the proposed nanostraw design, transfection protocol, and cell preparation improves immune cell delivery efficiency, and optimize the process to achieve >50% transfection efficiency with primary immune cells. Market analysis has found this level of transfection efficiency would be transformative to researchers and clinicians using primary immune cells. The transfection protocol will be optimized and codified into a simple to follow set of instructions. A turn-key instrument will be developed to carry out these procedures for use by life science researchers, with reduced device costs through improved manufacturing techniques to be competitive with currently available methods. The market-ready product will be evaluated by eight preclinical immune cell research beta sites to discover new treatment pathways.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is developing a safe and sustainable ink for
    the global ink industry. Approximately nine billion pounds of ink is produced
    annually around the world.  Currently, ink is predominantly made of petroleum
    or inorganic chemicals mined from the earth. For example, carbon black is commonly
    used in traditional ink, which is derived from petroleum, not biodegradable, and
    toxic for humans. To solve this problem, nature has produced a multitude of molecules
    capable of replacing pigments currently utilized in ink. While many organisms
    that produce these alternatives are slow growing and require energy sources like
    sugar, photosynthetic microbes, such as cyanobacteria, are capable of being engineered
    in an efficient manner to produce pigments in ink formulations that are safe,
    renewable, and 100% biodegradable. This ink will be used by businesses for printing
    packaging, marketing material, and other printed products. Developing and integrating
    these ink products will decrease significantly the overall detrimental impact
    of traditional inks on the environment, and more importantly, human health. \n\nThis
    SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop sustainable ink formulations using cyanobacteria
    as feedstock for producing optically black pigments for printing inks. This project
    will also engineer cyanobacteria cells capable of generating cellular pigments
    for a color spectrum of cyan, magenta, and yellow. These colored cyanobacteria
    will act as pigments that replace mined pigments found in traditional ink formulations,
    such as carbon black and cadmium. This project is developing a unique process
    in which extraction of pigments/dyes is not necessary, thus saving energy and
    reducing cost.   Using cyanobacteria cells as pigments creates a renewable source
    of biomass for bio-products, as these organisms leverage sunlight, carbon dioxide,
    wastewater and land otherwise unsuitable for conventional agriculture to rapidly
    generate biomass. In addition to the development of colorful renewable cyanobacteria
    strains, this project will focus on manufacturing thousands of pounds of ink products
    for testing and consumer use as well as testing the applicability of these natural
    pigments to act as colorants in the food and textile industries.\n\nThis award

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project has the potential to help enhance disease resistance in poultry and increase yields due to the delivery of only healthy, fully vaccinated chicks to farms. These healthier chicks will reduce the need for antibiotics in poultry, aiding to combat antimicrobial resistance.  This technology has immediate applications in other food animal industries and fisheries, and allows for data capture on numbers of animals and types of treatments given. Broader applications would include any image capture and analysis that relies on analytics to identify target areas for delivery of substances to live animals or humans.


    This SBIR Phase II project will allow for the advancement and commercialization of imaging technologies for the use of screening and targeting live animals. This proposal brings innovation in the care of food animals allowing for producers to move away from flock health and focus on the care of individual animals. This will be a dramatic change for the poultry industry, but is necessary in the face of antibiotic removal to be able to improve the current vaccination efficiencies and screen chicks for health status. Individualized care is currently not possible due to the high throughput needed to keep pace with large scale commercial hatchery operation. The technical challenges this proposal will overcome include 1) the safe and effective handling of chicks in an automated system that can process 100,000 chicks per hour, 2) the development of imaging systems for health checks and target recognition, 3) the delivery of the appropriate dose of vaccine with the correct amount of agents (virus, bacteria, parasite, and other agents) while not damaging the agents during delivery, and 4) development of a system that is rugged and robust enough to survive in a hatchery environment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to establish a broadly applicable, breakthrough biocatalytic technology to produce an important class of compounds called chiral cyclopropanes.  Cyclopropanes are key intermediates that are used in the synthesis of drugs, crop protection agents, and high-value electronic chemicals. Products accessible using this technology have markets totaling more than $10 billion annually. If successful, the technology under development will create safer, cleaner, more sustainable routes to important chemical products that will lower cost by reducing the number of production steps, lowering the required capital investment, significantly decreasing waste. Replacing existing chemical routes with the more efficient and sustainable enzyme-catalyzed steps will also improve the purity of many advanced pharmaceutical intermediates used in the manufacture of drugs and crop protection chemicals.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to build on the results from Phase 1 in which a highly efficient biocatalytic process for the manufacture of the drug ticagrelor was developed using a novel, engineered enzyme. We will create an expanded set of cyclopropanation biocatalysts with the capability to act on a wider range of starting materials, thereby broadening the scope and utility of this new enzymatic reaction. We will complete the development and commercialization of the process for production of the key intermediate for ticagrelor and initiate work to develop novel biocatalysts to produce ley intermediates for anti-viral drugs. We will also develop and commercialize a set of enzymes that can be used by drug discovery chemists to establish efficient routes for next-generation drugs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of software and monitoring system for the conservation of water resources and the economic sustainability of agricultural crop producers. Agricultural production uses a great deal of water. In California alone, 80% percent of all water usage goes to agriculture. As communities expand and drought conditions develop, the competition for scarce and expensive water resources has become intense. Growers need to minimize costs and water needs by making their irrigation practices more efficient. While new irrigation application technologies have reduced losses from wind drift, leakages and evaporation, large amounts of water are still be wasted as it washes through the soil past crop roots. The technology developed in this project will allow producers to track soil moisture movement through the soil profile and across fields. This will allow producers to develop irrigation strategies based on the unique conditions of their soil types and topography and reduce water waste. It will save producers money and enable them to stay in business and meet new governmental regulations regarding irrigation. Improvements in water management efficiencies and better crop management practices can increase crop production and uniformity, reduce food costs, and help preserve the environment.

    This SBIR Phase II project addresses priority challenges currently facing growers, producers, and agricultural scientists in effectively using water for crop (food) production. Soil and crop scientists have been examining the need for acquiring higher resolution moisture and temperature data throughout the root zone and across the landscape. A science-based approach is needed to optimally determine the number, location, and depths of sensors to accurately measure, and then model, soil properties for use in precise, effective and efficient water and crop management. Moreover, for perennial crops such as wine grapes, there also is a need to develop models and predictions relating these environmental conditions and historical data to crop quality and volume as well as long-term tree/vine health. The proposed technology uses novel visual analytics to organize the resulting massive data flows and novel predictive models to allow stakeholders to perform precision management of crops based on soil moisture conditions and other field conditions that have not been possible to date.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from greatly improving mobile app user experience, boosting developer productivity, and speeding up mobile innovations by automating the mundane and simplifying the complex in Android app testing.  Apps are now everywhere.  They innovate almost every industry.  By making it easy to build high-quality apps, users enjoy better experience and developers enjoy better productivity, benefiting every industry and person that use apps.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to modernize the software development process by combining both program analysis research breakthroughs and big data technologies. Toward this vision, this project aims to build a unique product with innovative technologies to help developers automatically test Android apps. The product continuously tests apps across code changes to detect issues such as performance regressions, crashes, and memory leaks, as soon as problematic code is introduced. In contrast, existing tools often alert developers too late, after real users have been affected and many code changes have been merged, making it both stressful and difficult to find the problematic code. The proposed product gives actionable diagnosis by pinpointing what problematic code developers need to fix and explaining the why and how of the fix. It is thus much more intelligent and easy to use than existing tools.

    will result in risk content that can be aggregated, displayed, and analyzed in
    original ways. This enables security managers at these organizations to better

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in providing state-of-the-art tools allowing anyone to build and deploy domain specific commercial intelligent virtual assistant (IVA) solutions. These tools allow others to understand how IVAs should be architected and integrate IVA technology into their offerings. IVAs have shown promise in numerous commercial domains including financial services, healthcare, education, law enforcement, and retail, to name a few, reducing the barrier to knowledge access within domains by providing a medium for people to converse naturally with sophisticated computer and information systems.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the significant technological challenges involved when scaling the domains and capabilities of an Intelligent Virtual Assistant (IVA). This project will innovate in designing scalable artificial intelligence models capable of learning and identifying hundreds or thousands of learned concepts, and designing the accompanying system architecture to support the growing compute demand of sophisticated algorithms. Specifically, the project aims at achieving: (1) Scalable Intelligence: the ability to handle hundreds or thousands of competencies and extractable semantic concepts, allowing users to interact with the system with unbounded, unconstrained language; (2) Customizable Intelligence: the ability to allow customers to (semi-) automatically train and (re)train and customize the intelligence on demand (adding new competencies, identifying new slot-value pairs, modify responses); (3) Conversational Complexity: support multi-turn conversations, where the context from prior utterances is used to refine and understand what the end-user is trying to accomplish; and (4) Scalable System Infrastructure: enhance open source IVA software infrastructure to seamlessly scale up and down the computational resources allocated for each intelligence engine based on load.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of novel high-brightness fluorescence compounds (fluorophores). These compounds will find applications in flow cytometry, a laser-induced fluorescence technique that can analyze thousands of cells per second. This efficient technique is important for clinical diagnosis, and research in the areas of blood cancer, STEM cells, and drug development. In a flow cytometry test, each cell structure is stained with a known fluorophore that is conjugated with a specific biomarker. Thus, the population of all cell structures and types can be determined simultaneously by analyzing the fluorescence signals. Unfortunately, such analysis requires experienced engineers, reliable equipment, and high-performance reagents. The proposed high-brightness fluorophores will enhance the performance of equipment and reagents, and enable the detection of low abundant cell structures without complicated signal processing. In addition, these fluorophores will improve data reliability, reduce research and drug development time, and cost. These compounds also will simplify the design and reduce the cost of flow cytometry equipment, which will help to expand market adoption. The commercial impact of this technology is expected to be significant, as the market size for flow cytometry is expected to be $2.2 billion by 2018.

    This STTR Phase II project aims to establish a platform technology for the production of high-brightness fluorophores that can emit in various colors. In principle, flow cytometry could simultaneously detect up to 30 different parameters with 30 color signals. However, due to the issues of spillover (signal overlap), and auto-fluorescence (background noise), the current technology allows for just two- to eight-color analysis to ensure accuracy. These issues could be resolved in part by a complicated signal analysis, but this approach may be prone to analysis errors. The proposed high-brightness fluorophores are designed to overcome spillover by increasing the weak signals of low abundance cells. In addition, these fluorophores also may reduce or eliminate the need of autofluorescence background compensation by increasing the signal to noise ratios. A higher signal to noise ratio will enable scientists to obtain well-resolved data with more accurate conclusions within a shorter amount of time. This technology will allow the detection and sorting of low abundance cells, and will promote the progress of immunology studies, cancer research, as well as technology for early disease detection. This will enabling flow cytometry equipment to be used to its full potential for reliable multi-color detection, which will lead to better patient and research outcomes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project stems from the development and commercialization of a networked-based, easy-to-use, fast and accurate tool that will allow architects, consultants, manufacturers of green building products to quickly compare, manipulate and optimize lighting strategies, perform whole-building annual glare analysis and access recommended manufactured products as solutions, to help make informed decisions for integrated design. Daylighting is a crucial piece of the green building puzzle. With the appropriate tools, daylighting is arguably one of the most cost-effective methods of achieving high performance buildings (and happier, healthier occupants) throughout the design process. World-wide green building is expected to double every three years. The world's green building market is a trillion-dollar industry, moreover, the green building materials market is expected to reach $234 billion by 2019. By 2018, green construction will directly contribute 1.1 million jobs and $75.6 billion in wages by 2018 in the United States. Between 2015 and 2018, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified buildings in the United States are estimated to have $1.2 billion in energy savings. Green buildings use fewer energy and water resources; save money for families, businesses and taxpayers; reduce carbon emissions; and prioritize environmental and human health.


    This projects proposes to create robust software for measuring, analyzing, and for recommending solutions to glare in buildings. A novel dynamic tree parallelization architecture is proposed to manage complex, dynamic, and massive amounts of lighting calculations. This will include building the first commercial grade 3 and 5 phase lighting analysis engine. It will also produce a new generation artifact for creating and manipulating data for glare analysis. It will conclude with a validation study.

    standard for AR, VR, Robotics and IoT applications with broad societal impact in education,
    medical and healthcare. Its broader impact is further amplified by the potential in serving the
    needs of the disabled community in improving their quality of life by being better able to
    communicate, learn and adapt to their interaction needs.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase 2 project aims to significantly
    advance current 3D hand gesture recognition technology by developing a dynamic hand
    tracking model for gesture intent recognition. It is robust against occlusion and tolerant to
    variations in camera orientation and position. This research will result in a transformative
    leap above the current state of academic and commercial hand models and overcome key
    technical hurdles that have so far proven difficult to overcome. It solves the following key
    challenges and involves very high technical risks: 1) robust hand tracking while holding
    objects and 2) robust tangible interactions using objects without using any fiducial markers
    2) low profile hand wearable for touch interaction detection. This Phase 2 project will
    achieve these objectives by 1) data acquisition and hand-object pose estimation, 2)
    understanding user intents with enhanced tangible interactions, and 3) system validation
    and user testing.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project, if successful, will be to demonstrate the potential
    of the technology to dramatically reduce the cost and risk currently associated
    with production of bio-based products, enabling ultra-low cost product development.
    The field of metabolic engineering historically has been limited in predicting
    the behavior of complex biological systems in vivo from simplified models and
    basic in vitro biochemical principles. In many cases, it has proven much more
    difficult than expected to integrate a well characterized production pathway into
    a living host and balance the complex requirements of both biomass growth and
    production. The technology under development is a first of its kind, truly scalable,
    high-throughput metabolic engineering platform enabling the rapid development
    of microbial production strains. This significant reduction in development cost
    enables the possibility to produce numerous specialty products that would otherwise
    not have acceptable internal return on development capital. \n\nThis SBIR Phase
    II project will develop a high throughput metabolic engineering platform that
    enables the rapid development of microbial production strains. The platform, which
    bridges a gap between current in vivo and in vitro bio-production approaches,
    relies on the dynamic minimization of the active metabolic network in the context
    of a standardized two-stage bioprocess. Metabolic networks are highly interconnected
    wherein each metabolite and/or enzyme can interact with endless others. This combinatorial
    complexity results in a huge potential design space, which is intractable to the
    kinds of systematic experimentation required for the development of standardized
    design principles. The global challenges in addressing such a large biological
    design space have persisted, despite the dramatic advances in, and decreased costs
    of, reading and writing DNA, high-throughput DNA assembly, and microbial strain
    construction approaches. Dynamic metabolic network minimization not only results
    in a design space with greatly reduced complexity, but also provides strains that
    are robust to environmental conditions. Robustness leads to predictable scalability
    from high-throughput small-scale screens or \"microfermentations\" to fully instrumented
    bioreactors. This project will extend the validation of predictable strain performance
    from high-throughput microfermentation to pilot scale fermentation."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a platform technology for point of care (POC) detection of disease biomarkers present in low concentrations in bodily fluids. This technology can greatly impact the current standard medical workflow by reducing the time-to-results from days or weeks to 15 minutes, allowing for disease screenings during routine doctors visits supporting early diagnosis and improved treatment monitoring. It will promote preventative care, and therefore lead to improved treatment outcomes, patient satisfaction, and reduced healthcare costs. This technology will be incorporated into a portable, low-powered device that can be operated in-the-field, in low-resource settings in the US and internationally, supporting better healthcare monitoring that is often absent in under-served segments of society. The first target application is the detection of liver cancer, a disease that, when diagnosed late, has an extremely high mortality rate and cost of treatment. The proposed system may aid in the screening and early diagnosis of liver cancer. Furthermore, due to the technology?s inherent potential for multiplexing, it may be possible to simultaneous detect multiple biomarkers for chronic liver disease (Hep B, C, and cirrhosis), increasing its applicability to a global patient pool of over 500 million patients.

    Medicine is increasingly focused on personalized and preventative care and hence there is an increasing demand for diagnostic tools that can facilitate rapid screening, diagnosis, and treatment monitoring. Most current POC tests on the market are lateral flow based and do not target high sensitivity applications like cancer biomarkers, which require quantitative results and are present in low concentrations in blood. The goal of this Phase II project is to develop a standalone diagnostic system consisting of a portable reader and disposable cartridges to rapidly diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via the quantitative detection of AFP. During year 1, a 20-sensor very-high frequency (VHF) biochip will be designed and fabricated, simultaneously the whole blood processing component of the cartridge will be developed and integrated to form an all-inclusive cartridge. A distributed standalone electronic system will also designed and tested in year 1. Year 2 will involve the integration of the reader components to form a standalone system, additionally the all-inclusive cartridge will modified to interface with the reader allowing for plug and play operation. The performance of the integrated system will be evaluated via detection of HCC biomarkers in registry samples and comparison to the current standard of care.

    improving student achievement in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM)
    concepts through the development of an innovative video software platform that
    leverages the benefits of video-based active learning in the educational environment.
    STEM fields are widely regarded as vital to a nation's economy, but a disconnect
    exists between the STEM knowledge and skills that students acquire in schools
    and those that they need to succeed in an increasingly global, technology-dependent
    workplace. Phase II research will enable development and testing of a video and
    peer review tool that will merge the core inquiry steps of successful scientists
    with state-of-the-art video proprietary technology, and allow collaboration between
    students and teachers located anywhere in the country. Commercialization of this
    technology will provide school districts with a needed educational tool to help
    teachers direct and assess STEM activities, and support students as they learn
    critical thinking skills and master STEM concepts, a mastery fundamental to successful
    careers in science and engineering. Encouraging the growth of students' STEM competency
    through this technology will encourage the growth of scientific innovations of
    the future, supporting domestic jobs and a strong financial tax foundation for
    our country's economic prosperity. \n\nThe technical innovation in this SBIR project
    is an educational video software platform designed as a framework for STEM critical
    science inquiry, incorporating proprietary source code, student peer review, teacher
    assessment, analytics, a searchable database, and secure class-to-class video
    sharing. Each project requires that students work within a framework mirroring
    the best practices of professional scientists: Students organize concepts in terms
    of hypotheses, evidence, and analysis, and communicate their evidence-based projects
    to be peer reviewed. The secure video software platform is designed to be used
    within high schools and integrated into teachers' existing Learning Management
    Systems (LMS) to assess student progress. The goals and scope of the research
    are to develop the interactive video player source code that supports the educational
    framework and then demonstrate the results of this platform on student achievement
    utilizing a standardized achievement test.  These goals will be accomplished through
    several tasks focused on software development to incorporate secure account creation,
    peer-review interactivity, and LMS integration, followed by demonstration of class-to-class
    connectivity of the platform. A pilot study will assess the software platform?s
    functionality and validate its potential to significantly increase high school
    student critical thinking and scientific inquiry measures on a standardized test."

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from improving the efficiency in facilities
    management (FM) of institutional and commercial buildings by enabling a streamlined
    transition to efficient, proactive operations using the power of big data analytics.
    This provides an opportunity to reduce estimated $78.5 Billion - $127.3 Billion
    in waste due to reactive maintenance per year in the US commercial facilities
    market alone.  A data driven, proactive approach provides a unique opportunity
    that enable facilities managers to assess as-is conditions of assets, avoid non
    value-add activities and plan maintenance tasks to avoid failures and shutdown.
    This will contribute towards transforming a traditional industry to an advanced
    data-driven one.  It will also enable significant reduction in the disruptions
    caused to occupants due to failures in facilities.  Given that Americans spend
    85-90% of their time indoors and any disruptions caused by facilities directly
    impact their qualities of lives, the broader societal impact of reducing failures
    in facilities is significant.  \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
    Phase II project intends to research, develop and demonstrate the feasibility
    of using big data analytics and machine learning to transform facilities operations
    and maintenance decisions. Owners and operators of the over five million commercial
    and institutional buildings in the United States are faced with the challenges
    of managing aging and crowded building infrastructure. They waste between 30%
    and 40% of resources by operating in a predominantly inefficient, reactive mode.
    This project targets development of computational mechanisms that automatically
    analyze integrated building information to identify patterns that lead to actionable
    insights that help reduce non value-add activities and improve resource utilization
    in FM daily operation and planning. By combining advanced machine learning technologies
    with existing building information modeling (BIM) resources, the company is proposing
    to develop high-impact, statistical and visual methods for optimizing the decision-making
    abilities of facility managers and with that, the performance of critical facilities
    infrastructure and maintenance crews.  The results of this research will include
    algorithms and methods to normalize heterogeneous building data, detect patterns
    and anomalies, from which actionable insights can be derived with domain knowledge,
    and generate qualitative and quantitative output appropriate for improved decision
    making in managing commercial facilities."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to enable significant improvement in the shelf-life of unstable natural food ingredients and enable replacing artificial with natural colors in a large portfolio of products of interest to the food and beverage industries. Consumer demand for all-natural ingredients in food has increased multifold, primarily due to health concerns. Despite the strong consumer demand, delivery and stability of natural food colors pose a great challenge for the food and beverage industry. This challenge results due to an inherent chemical instability of natural ingredients and due to their accelerated degradation during food processing and storage. But the current solutions are not cost-effective and require the use of synthetic additives and preservatives, which are not desired by the consumers. This project is aimed at providing an array of low-cost, stable natural ingredients that will improve the overall stability of the finished products both during food processing and storage. This will also address the unmet societal needs for healthy food ingredients and improving sustainability of food products.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop bio-based encapsulation solutions to improve natural food color and phytochemical stability in food and beverage products. Current solutions are sub-optimal providing limited pH (color), heat or oxidative stability and short expiration dates on food and beverage products. To address this unmet need, this project aims to develop encapsulation of natural colors and bioactives that will enhance the overall stability of a finished food product. This will be achieved by working on the primary objectives of this project: Selection and screening of the carriers and natural ingredients to be encapsulated, physico-chemical stability testing of the encapsulated ingredients, scale-up methodologies, stability testing in a finished food/beverage product, consumer evaluation and customer validation of the formulations. As a result of the proposed approach, solutions will be provided that will allow the food and beverage industry to replace artificial with natural colorants as well as significantly extend shelf-life of their desired food products. This will also benefit the consumer who is seeking natural health-promoting ingredients in what he/she consumes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in improving the performance of the computational back-end of a display system that delivers personalized information in public spaces. Currently, the primary method for an individual to receive customized information in public spaces is through personal devices. The heavy use of personal devices in public often leads to heads-down, isolating, and even hazardous situations. The delivery of personalized information through infrastructure can significantly improve these issues. However, the bandwidth requirements in doing so have been prohibitively high using standard computational architectures. This project aims to improve the performance of such a system, allowing practical applications that will broadly enhance safety, accessibility, transportation, and other areas.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on creating a scalable computational pipeline and architecture that will allow a display system to direct personalized visual information in real-time to large numbers of people. Technically, this involves computing, transmitting, and displaying image data for large crowds in parallel. The architecture takes advantage of the inherent redundancies in this application to provide a cost-effective solution. The goal of the project is to create a computational back-end capable of driving, in real-time, a system equivalent to thousands of displays.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a drug screening system that will accelerate drug discovery for several eye diseases, including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and macular edema.  This technology will fulfill unmet needs of small and large biopharmaceutical companies engaged in drug discovery for various eye diseases by reducing development cost, expediting preclinical research, and increasing the chances of clinical success.  From the socio-economic standpoint, this technology will result in the development of more effective ocular drugs that will decrease eye disease treatment cost. Furthermore, this model will facilitate more rapid development of technologies for the diagnosis of glaucoma and new surgical techniques in the management of this disease.  Overall, this screening system will accelerate the development of medications for eye diseases, enhancing the quality of life for millions of people.

    This SBIR Phase II project will address the lack of effective models for testing targeted glaucoma therapeutics and additional ocular diseases.  Currently, none of the available glaucoma medications target the eye tissue responsible for this disease due to absence of clinically relevant testing platform that incorporates this particular eye tissue. Presently, animal or human cadaver eyes are used to study and test the effects of medications on such tissue, however, these preparations are cumbersome and expensive. The proposed work will be the first-of-its-kind to engineer physiologically-relevant 3D human eye tissues utilizing novel cell culture methods along with microfabrication techniques and a microfluidic system. These 3D tissues will facilitate the development of disease-relevant in vitro model systems for understanding not only glaucoma but also diabetic retinopathy and macular edema pathology. This tool will help increase the success rate of glaucoma and ocular vasculature-related medications at later stages of drug development pipeline.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a software platform for the engineering of living systems. Specifically, it will complete a software ecosystem that builds upon a core set of computational tools for the specification, design, build, test, analyze, and archive activities in synthetic biology and couple them with a rich set of interfaces to expert services (e.g., DNA synthesis, data analysis). The proposed work involves the completion of state-of-the-art design approaches and algorithms and couples it with the ability to create customized, modular workflows based on genetic circuit design, metabolic pathway modification, and genome engineering. The proposed work advances computational approaches in synthetic biology as well as innovating in the way that software services are monetized with biotechnology companies. The anticipated result of this work is a commercial software package and associated service agreements that can be deployed to both large and small biotechnology companies fundamentally changing the way that synthetic biology designs are conceived, designed, and physically created.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a software platform where the goal is to combine bio-design automation (BDA) software with explicitly integrated access to expert services in a workflow-driven software ecosystem.  The creation of novel living systems using biotechnology to engineer new medicines, materials, and fuels is frequently an ad-hoc process involving long iteration cycles, wasted resources, and sub-optimal designs. The software will allow for the automated specification, design, fabrication, test, and archival of complete plans for the engineering of novel engineered biological systems. This software includes mechanisms for specifying biological "rules," DNA assembly strategies, and automated generation of robotic instructions.  In particular, this effort will focus on the creation of genetic circuits, engineered metabolic pathways, and genome engineering.  The approach provides tools representing state-of-the-art advances in BDA while introducing novel methods of interacting with a large, diverse set of expert service providers. Further, the approach will empower novice experimentalists while enabling expert computational engineers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the production of enhanced-nutrition soybeans that have high levels of protein for use in aquafeed. Meat and fish consumption is rapidly growing due to increased world population and affluence. Aquaculture is the fastest growing food sector. Small wild-caught fish are used for aquaculture feed. Wild-caught fish harvests have not changed in 25 years and overfishing small fish jeopardizes the marine ecosystem. Aquafeed producers are turning to soy-based protein to replace fishmeal but soy-based proteins lack taurine and are deficient in methionine, two important nutrients for fish. To meet fish nutritional requirements, producers supplement soy-based aquafeed with synthetic taurine and methionine. In addition to added costs, synthetic taurine and methionine are produced from hazardous substances, and synthetic taurine has been shown to contain arsenic. Successful development of enhanced-nutrition soybean seeds would reduce the amount of supplemental nutrients required in aquafeed, a $2.2B global annual cost predicted for 2020, and could save aquafeed producers 20% of their additive feed costs. Enhanced-nutrition soybean seeds would be an economical, healthy, sustainable, environmentally friendly and secure source of taurine and methionine for the rapidly growing aquaculture industry.

    This SBIR Phase II project will use a biotechnology approach to increase the essential nutrients in soybean seeds for use in aquafeed. Many aquafeed producers use plant-based protein, primarily from soybean, as a replacement for fishmeal. However, plants lack some nutrients required for normal fish growth and development. Taurine and methionine, two nutrients either lacking or limited in soybean, are supplemented to soy-based aquafeed, thus increasing feed-production costs. The goal of this project is to increase the levels of taurine and methionine produced in the seeds of a commercial-grade, high-protein soybean variety that has high feed digestibility. Molecular and biochemical methods will be used to identify soybean seeds with: (1) taurine and high methionine levels; (2) uncompromised quality and viability; (3) unaffected levels of other nutrients; (4) normal to higher-than-normal protein content; and (5) low levels of nondigestible compounds. The anticipated results are the production of soybean seeds with a minimum of 0.2% taurine (dry seed weight) and at least 50% more total methionine compared with control seeds.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to address a strong commercial and scientific need for operational synthesis of spatially consistent and temporally relevant historical and current high resolution satellite imagery for analytical purposes. The technology will contribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge especially in the geospatial arena and to market spillovers. By dramatically simplifying access to accurate imagery for any time and place, this technology will provide companies, researchers, educators, students, and regular citizens with a valuable tool for visualizing and exploring our changing planet and will contribute to increasing public engagement with science and technology. Further, the analytical capabilities offered by the imagery have great potential in scientific applications thus contributing to partnerships between academia and industry and improving datasets for research and education. Finally, this technology will be valuable in operational settings at the large providers of commercial satellite imagery, to individual users, and enable a wide variety of new visualization, analysis, and data mining applications. The examples of commercial applications for the technology are virtual earth, insurance and reinsurance, agriculture, emergency, change detection.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will operationally synthesize accurate regional-to-global, high spatial / high temporal satellite imagery of the Earth. The technology will utilize advanced data fusion algorithms to combine various sources of imagery while preserving the best spatial and temporal attributes of the data sources. The complexity of accessing, processing, and analyzing various sources of satellite imagery creates a significant barrier to its use. Synthesis of regionally and globally continuous high spatial / high temporal resolution imagery is a challenge as in addition to inherent differences in spatial and temporal resolutions of the source data, the new models need to account for enormous data volumes and sparse coverage of high spatial resolution imagery. Existing techniques to handle these challenges have severe limitations which curtail their use outside of the research arena. The technology will overcome these limitations by implementing algorithms that are robust, automated, scalable, deliver accurate data, and are usable in operational settings. They will provide spatially consistent and temporally relevant imagery which will empower businesses with regional and global outreach to make better decisions with better data.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to develop a new technology that combines advanced bioengineering with traditional chemical manufacturing. This hybrid approach will allow production of high value chemicals for the polymer industry using biomass at a lower price than current petrochemical based processes. This unique approach allows for the retrofit of existing ethanol fermentation facilities in rural areas with a bolt-on chemical upgrading unit to produce chemicals with far higher value than ethanol, improving the economics of operating these facilities and creating new jobs. The initial chemical product targeted by this project has an estimated $100M annual market and is used in manufacturing a variety of consumer products including specialty polyurethanes, inks, and UV degradable plastics which can be dramatically expanded to $1B by 2020 through cost reductions enabled by this new technology. Eventually, this approach combining existing fermentation facilities with a bolt-on chemical processing unit can be used to produce carbon-neutral fuels that are fully compatible with gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel at price comparable to current petrochemical fuels. This project, while here focused on the higher value polymer market, will enable later development of cost competitive fuel production technology.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to demonstrate at pilot scale a complete downstream process capable of manufacturing the target chemical from the intermediate platform molecule produced with fermentation. In upstream Visolis work, the key intermediate has been produced using fermentation facilities hosted at the Advanced Biofuels Process Demonstration Unit at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories and the National Renewable Research Laboratories (NREL) at pilot scale, and based on current performance metrics the intermediate can be manufactured at prices comparable to ethanol at commercial scale. The goals of this downstream project are to utilize the intermediate generated using a 9000L scale fermentation facility at NREL to demonstrate cost-effective production of the target product from this intermediate. The work includes construction of a pilot scale high pressure chemical reactor, production and testing of several catalysts for performance in producing the target molecule at different process conditions, optimization of the chemical production process, evaluation of the process and catalyst for long-term stability, purification of the products to the levels required by customers, and technoeconomic modeling to inform the design of a commercial facility.

- abstractText: "The broader impact / commercial potential of this Small Business
    Innovation Research Phase II project is to offer a low-cost novel filter to purify
    water with higher effectiveness and superior performance than currently available
    technologies such as carbon filters. The global water scarcity, including some
    parts of the US such as the southwest, has led to a strong need for efficient
    technologies to purify wastewater for direct or indirect potable reuse. Recently,
    there has been growing concerns over emerging contaminants such as perfluorinated
    compounds (PFCs e.g. PFOA and PFOS) in surface and groundwater. These PFCs are
    being found at many groundwater sites and in drinking water wells affected by
    PFCs. Current technologies are not efficient for the removal of PFCs from water,
    and there is an immediate need for new cost-effective treatment technologies.
    To address this unfulfilled need, this project seeks to develop a low cost, reusable
    filter unit for water purification to remove emerging contaminants such as PFCs.
    The technology is expected to be used by entities conducting industrial wastewater
    and groundwater treatment, and wastewater utilities that have a focus on water
    reuse. \n\nThe objectives of this Phase II research project are to develop a prototype
    water filter,  test and optimize it for the removal of emerging contaminants with
    a focus on PFCs. Specifically, the project will focus on: (1) optimization of
    the adsorbent performance and synthesis method; and scale-up of the synthesis
    method for bulk production of filter media; (2) optimization of the filter regeneration
    process; and (3) design, construct, and test a prototype unit of the technology;
    and determine the process cost. The work will confirm the effectiveness of the
    filter in removing the target contaminants as well as the effectiveness of the
    regeneration process to reuse the filter. The PFC contaminants will be first removed
    from the water and then destroyed. The overall performance of the technology will
    also be evaluated and compared with other available technologies to determine
    its cost-effectiveness."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to significantly improve outcomes for cardiothoracic surgical patients while reducing healthcare costs by ensuring proper post-surgical drainage. In the United States, approximately 750,000 major cardiothoracic surgeries are performed each year. Each of these patients receives an average of two chest tubes to drain fluid and facilitate proper recovery, but approximately 36% of chest tubes become clogged. Patients with clogged chest tubes are more likely to experience post-surgical complications, which can result in life-threatening conditions and significantly increase the cost of care. To mitigate the risk of clogging, surgeons typically use large-bore chest tubes, which are more likely to be misplaced and to cause injury to surrounding organs. The novel device under development addresses these issues by preventing clog formation in small-bore chest tubes, thus maintaining proper fluid drainage. Anticipated impacts of the device include reduced time to ambulation and discharge, hospital readmissions, and nursing time. Commercially, the device addresses a $300 million initial market opportunity and has the potential to save the U.S. healthcare system approximately $1.7 billion per year from costs associated with preventable chest tube complications.

    The proposed project aims to develop a novel chest tube device to address the clinical need of maintaining proper fluid drainage after cardiothoracic surgery while enabling the use of small-bore chest tubes. Existing systems are prone to clogging, which can lead to life-threatening conditions, longer hospital stays, and increased costs. Building on the feasibility demonstrated in Phase I, the objective of this research is to continue development of the device and prepare for market entry; the research will be performed in three Aims. In the first Aim, critical aspects of usability and manufacturability will be addressed and incorporated into the final device design. In the second Aim, verification and validation activities will be performed to ensure the device meets all safety and functional requirements before clinical use. In the third Aim, the device?s supplemental ability to monitor lung healing status in patients undergoing thoracic surgery will be refined and tested on the benchtop and in an in vivo animal study.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in enabling more efficient Annual Wind Energy Production (AEP) while reducing the cost of energy (COE). This will make wind energy more attractive economically, improve the energy security of the U.S, create jobs, and indirectly help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A 2% AEP increase is generally considered attractive. Two turbines (5kW and 50kW) tested during Phase I have shown an increase in AEP between 2% to 8% while reducing the COE by 1% to 6%. About 150,000 turbines worldwide can be potentially be retrofitted with this technology.

    This project will address challenges related to aerodynamic efficiency of wind turbines and the cost of wind energy. It is based on a deeper understanding of wind turbine aerodynamics from a more 3-dimensional point of view; most wind turbine designs are based on 2- dimensional theories. The key technical challenge in bringing this technology to market is to demonstrate the increase in AEP of utility scale turbines retrofitted with our deflector technology in realistic field conditions while reducing the COE. This will be addressed by performing testing at a few customer wind farms and NREL testing centers. The R&D plan consists of designing, manufacturing, and installing deflectors on a few utility size turbines (30-100 meters diameter rotors). The tests will include power performance comparison between baseline and retrofitted turbines according to international standards.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of an informatics-based software platform that will help pharmaceutical companies create more new, effective, and safe drugs earlier in the R&D pipeline. This software platform will address a need for data integration and analysis tools to aid pharmaceutical researchers in 1) phenotypic screening, 2) toxicology analysis, and 3) drug repurposing. It will help these researchers quickly gather and interpret complex molecular and phenotypic data, making the drug discovery process more efficient and creating value for pharmaceutical companies. The economic impact of reducing the preclinical drug discovery process by just two weeks is estimated to be a $252 million cost savings for the industry. By using data more effectively earlier in the R&D process, this software platform also promises to enhance the quality of drugs that enter clinical trials. Thus, it provides an opportunity to reduce overall R&D spending and increase the number of drugs that enter the market - resulting in more economically priced medicines available to the population.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to build an informatics-based software platform that solves cross-domain data integration, analysis, and user application challenges in order to effectively use data to draw insights earlier in the R&D process and compress the development pipeline for new or repurposed drugs. Using highly scalable semantic graph technologies, a flexible three-layer architecture is being developed that includes the 1) Biomedical Data Layer, 2) Computational Layer, and 3) Application Layer. This architecture allows the system be fully scalable and extensible to other datasets and biomedical applications. The system will be beta-tested by pharmaceutical researchers and evaluated though the creation of scientifically relevant use-cases. This development will result in a commercial software system that makes important biomedical data and insights available to all researchers within a pharmaceutical organization by addressing high need data integration, analysis, and application challenges.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to fundamentally change what a storage device can do, and give storage a third capability that is not addressed by existing storage technology - the ability to actually process user data.  For the computation to take place, only the computational request and the resulting data need to transfer over the storage interface, reducing interface traffic and the required power. The advent of Big Data and the increasing use of Hyperscale Server technology have resulted in the creation of an additional storage tier that is different from traditional enterprise storage. This new tier requires significantly larger capacity yet lower cost, lower operating power, and yet must still exhibit enterprise level reliability. This combination of characteristics cannot be serviced by existing technologies, and execution with large data sets typical of Big Data results in inefficient solutions. The information being stored represents the large, unstructured data mined by today's companies for key information and trends that help dictate corporate direction, advertising, and monetization. Future applications include machine learning for video analytics, genome sequencing and enabling Fog Storage and Fog Computing, among others.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project explores the Big Data paradigm shift where processing capability is pushed as close to the data as possible. The In-Situ processing technology pushes this concept to the absolute limit, by putting the computational capability directly into the storage itself and eliminating the need to move data to main memory before processing. The technology innovation begins with a solid foundation of an enterprise SSD tailored for the needs of modern Data Centers. Key technology that will be added to support these capabilities include hardware-assisted quality of service control, low-cost 3D-TLC and QLC NAND Flash enablement through the use of advanced ECC, and a proprietary elastic Flash Translation Layer to support extremely large capacity drives. The final element added to this foundation will be the ability to perform computation directly on the data with the addition of specialized In-Situ processing aided by hardware accelerators.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that the proposed runtime verification technology will lead to a more robust definition of and architecture for ensuring safety in automobiles, medical devices, and aerospace and defense systems.  Through this, these forms of safety-critical infrastructure will be more resilient to attack and catastrophic failure resulting from both critical system failures and malicious attacks.  As a result, the technology will help to address a slew of recent problems with software failures, security compromises, and other unintentional software behaviors that inevitably occur as systems become more complex, potentially saving lives and making millions of safety-critical embedded systems safer, easier to upgrade, and better tested.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will commercialize a first-of-its-kind complete solution for runtime verification and software analysis specifically tailored for embedded systems.  From automobiles that connect to each other and drive autonomously, to control systems that run ever increasing networks that power our utilities, cities, and many other aspects of our daily lives, it is clear that embedded systems are here to stay in the most safety critical domains.  A growing problem in embedded systems is how to ensure they behave correctly; a good case study for this is automobiles, in which several high profile hacks and recalls have called into question the security and integrity of vehicles.  The proposed solution will fill this market niche with a suite of related analysis tools/modules, built on a common novel and formally rigorous runtime verification technology infrastructure, each module implementing unique instrumentation and analysis functionality.  These tools/modules together provide what is needed to develop safe embedded systems.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is aimed at improving healthcare patient outcomes,
    potentially saving lives, and decreasing healthcare costs. The Drug Quality and
    Security Act of 2013 set stricter manufacturing standards on sterile injectable
    compounded medications that have closed many third party suppliers, thus creating
    shortages and higher prices.  In response, the American Society of Hospital Pharmacists
    expects 40% of the US market, 2000 hospitals, by 2018 to receive insourced compounds.
    \ Hospitals that insource hope to decrease their costs and improve patient safety
    with higher quality product.  Today, insourcing hospitals often have multiple
    information systems and use paper records cobbling together how a compound is
    made and to whom it has been administered.  When an ingredient recall occurs,
    hospitals spend hundreds of man-hours identifying the problem source and affected
    patients. To prevent further patient risks speed is demanded. This SBIR Phase
    I project will provide hospitals the capability of an end-to-end quality management
    that will track every production process step and tracing medications to patients.
    \ Hospitals will be able to prevent patients from receiving recalled medications
    and identify quality production compromises thus improving patient outcomes and
    potentially saving lives.  \n\n\nThe proposed project is a novel medication barcoded
    label encryption technology compatible with existing hospital scanners to provide
    track and trace capabilities of intravenous medication compounds.   Key objectives
    include both patient specific and anticipatory workflows with labels, a Passive
    Auditing management system for compounding quality control, and an innovation
    to improve operating room environment medication barcode scanning compliance.
    \ Today, healthcare providers utilize multiple barcoded label technologies with
    minimal embedded medication data across disparate systems.  Medication labels
    could be the link across these systems for ingredient traceability.  However,
    existing solutions are inadequate to meet 2013 legislative traceability mandates.
    \ The project invention will encrypt serialization fields within the barcoded
    label connecting a specific medication to its production data, and eventually
    to the patient.  Compounding process data, such as ingredients, environmental
    conditions, and production instructions, will be connected to individual medication
    labels and stored in the patient?s electronic record.  When an ingredient is recalled
    or questionable process identified, an extraction algorithm will pull the encrypted
    data from the EHR and will be connected to production data. Success of this project
    will be label readability by existing hospital scanners and retrieval of the serialized
    data from the EHR"

    \ The proposed Quasi-Active Prosthetic Ankle System (QPAS) addresses the RH6:
    Human Assistive Technologies area.  QPAS will be lightweight, have a long battery
    life, and optimize the passive dynamics of amputee gait in unconstrained environments

    week.  Therefore, QPAS will have strong market potential and the significant societal
    impact of improving health by supporting a more active lifestyle for lower limb
    amputees.  This will also lead to more community and family involvement.  Additionally,
    because of the many possibilities to control QPAS, gait researchers will be able

    from reduced self-selected walking speed, increased metabolic cost, increased
    reaction loads on the sound limb, poor gait symmetry, and reduced stability with
    increased risk of falling.  Passive prosthetic feet are only tuned for level ground
    walking at one speed.  QPAS will utilize a patented compliant actuator to achieve
    a unique set of features: passive energy storage with an articulating ankle joint,
    adaptable ankle angle for slope gait, low electrical energy usage, a large range
    of ankle motion, adaptable stiffness to optimize variable cadence level ground
    and slope gait, and controlled energy delivery to ensure energy builds naturally
    and smoothly.  In this phase 2 SBIR, an intuitive and autonomous controller will
    be built for the QPAS and human subject evaluations will assist in refining the
    device towards commercialization. QPAS will become a successful product by focusing

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop an easy to use real-time formative assessment tool for educators that will be uniquely aligned to each student and deployed via a virtual reality learning game that uses venomous marine snails as a conduit for exploring scientific issues in nature. The USA is currently ranked 52nd in the world in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. This is detrimental intellectually and economically to the future of American society. Recent studies indicate it is not what is taught, but how it is taught that enhances student-learning abilities, particularly as it pertains to STEM. As a result, this project is driven by the research objectives to understand how children learn specific science content and why certain game elements are better suited to convey scientific material. The outcome of this project is a proprietary multi-tiered formative assessment tool that can measure real time student learning of novel STEM content obtained through a virtual reality learning game experience. This project will enable teachers to nimbly tailor future instruction with individualized student learning goals.  Commercialization of the products created in this project will transform scientific learning and measurable engagement in educational games for social and economic benefit to meet the NSF?s mission of supporting education initiatives that improve the lives of U.S. Citizens, and generate income for tax revenue and jobs via the employment of software designers, educators and scientists.

    The proprietary technology developed in this SBIR Phase II will be a first-of-its-kind assessment dashboard that will link virtual reality and web-based learning environments with formative assessment to fuel instruction and deepen learning. This project will build proprietary assessment tools into online and virtual reality games which continuously engage users in the process of scientific inquiry and discovery using novel formative assessments customized to each player. The proprietary assessment dashboard allows teachers and players to measure their progress in real-time and identify opportunities to enhance their STEM learning. Using Unity as the platform, player actions and decisions will be met with tailored formative assessments and ongoing feedback throughout game play. This feedback helps teachers delineate where their students are along their learning progressions and fuels further instruction. The novel approach of this assessment dashboard transforms qualitative and quantitative learning and has the potential to significantly enhance student engagement and commitment to scientific inquiry to support emerging science changemakers. The research objective of the player/teacher dashboard is to align feedback on student learning during game play with dynamic quantitative and qualitative formative assessment that create a seamless demonstration of knowledge acquisition while providing teachers with multiple opportunities to engage learners in deeper and more meaningful levels of inquiry before, during, and after gameplay. The products generated from this project are aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and the International Baccalaureate (IB) program to ensure the content is of the highest caliber and distribution is to a large global customer base.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop new alloys whose thermal expansion properties can be tailored for laser applications. The tailored thermal expansion alloys will prevent shifts in laser output frequencies, i.e. laser color, by preventing the natural temperature-induced thermal expansion and contraction that occurs in laser housings. This temperature stability is extremely important for fiber-optic systems that are the backbone of the telecommunications industry. According to Strategies Unlimited, the telecommunications laser market was $3.515 billion in 2014, and it is expected to increase with the increasing number of mobile devices and growing demand for high-speed internet. While oil and gas telecommunications systems were identified as the beachhead market, the alloys developed through this project will also have potential to add value to the wider telecommunications market and a number of other industrial and electronics applications.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in a new method to exhibit unprecedented control over thermal expansion properties in metal alloys. The discovery that mechanical deformation tailors or "programs" the thermal expansion of a bulk metal to match that of other common materials (metals, polymers, and ceramics) will change the way scientists and engineers design for thermal compensation. These alloys can also be tailored not to expand or contract with temperature changes and even be made to shrink when heated. This wide range of tailored alloy responses is achieved without chemical changes or composite fabrication methods upon which competing technologies rely. This Phase II project will reduce the risks associated with implementing the tailored thermal expansion alloy technology in laser applications by developing high thermal conductivity alloys and testing prototypes. Alloys will be purchased, engineered to have a desired coefficient of thermal expansion, and tested for laser performance. The expected outcome of this work is the realization of tailored thermal expansion alloys in laser prototypes.

    Research Phase II project provides a technology platform to convert non-food biomass,
    such as wood and corn stalks, into biofuels, chemicals, and bioproducts. Biomass
    utilization is a solution to increase global sustainability and decrease petroleum-based
    greenhouse gas emissions. This project will use wood biomass to simultaneously
    co-produce three high-end products, dissolving pulp, furfural, and technical lignin,
    of which the dissolving pulp and furfural are the focus of this project. Current
    methods of producing these products only use one of the three primary biomass
    components. By co-producing two products, revenues increase and unit production
    costs decrease as production costs are spread over a larger product volume. The
    use of this solvent obtained from the biomass is a unique approach in the biomass
    conversion industry and offers an alternative to conventional enzyme or microbial
    processing. Benefits include restoring furfural production in the United States,
    decreasing dissolving pulp production costs, and increasing the commercial value
    of renewable biomass that currently has low or no value. This sustainable and
    environmentally friendly technology will increase global sustainability and revitalize
    rural economies by stimulating investment and creating jobs. \n\nThe objectives
    of this Phase II research project are to demonstrate and advance to pilot scale
    our technology to simultaneously co-produce dissolving pulp and furfural from
    biomass using gamma valerolactone (GVL) as solvent. While other technologies focus
    on the production of a single product from biomass, GVL?' ability to fractionate
    lignocellulosic biomass into its three main components (cellulose, hemicellulose,
    and lignin) at high concentration and purity, produce significant cost and technical
    advantages. GVL fractionation produces solid cellulose at high yield (>90%) and
    purity (>90%), without the need for pre-treatment or further chemical refining.
    This cellulose can be converted into dissolving pulp for high-end applications
    such as textiles (rayon), cellophane, or microcrystalline cellulose. The hemicellulose
    fraction does not need to be separated from the GVL and is readily converted into
    furfural within GVL at high yields (>75%) and high concentrations, minimizing
    separation costs. Preliminary mass and energy balances and techno-economic modeling
    based on lab data predict attractive financial returns. Tasks will focus on biomass
    fractionation to produce dissolving pulp, furfural purification, and GVL recovery
    at bench-scale. This experimental work will inform the engineering development
    for an integrated, continuous process, pilot demonstration unit."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to provide a usable stranded and associated gas collection capacity for oil & gas exploration companies. During drilling operations, valuable gas is lost through intentional venting and flaring, causing losses in natural gas delivered to the power plant or city gate. With the sector's expansion into more remote low-volume sites, these losses are increasing dramatically. Through this project's proposed novel Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) based storage technology, this project seeks to deliver a re-usable and transport ready intermodal container, to store gas at low pressure, eliminating the need to use expensive gas capture, purification and multi-stage compression systems. An economically feasible unprocessed natural gas storage technology would provide a useful tool for the domestic oil & gas industry in capturing what would be flared or vented and delivering it to the American economy. Taking the proposed novel MOF technology to the bench and pilot scale will show the feasibility of a flexible, transportable, low-cost infrastructure to abate flaring and venting. Successful developments in this project will help develop the knowledge for scale-up to large-scale vehicular tanks to allow for commercial implementation.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are the development of stable and low-cost Metal-Organic framework (MOF) based storage technologies for the collection of usable stranded associated gas during drilling operations. In order to harness point source emissions, before being vented or flared, the project will develop a nano-engineered, MOF based sorbent for low-pressure capture and storage of unprocessed natural gas. The project will seek to develop a robust and scalable method to synthesize new MOFs containing other high-valence transition metal ions such as Al3+, Fe3+ and Cr3+. Furthermore, the project will screen a range of organic ligands for improving MOFs' surface property and storage capacity. Finally, by following alternative synthesis routes with low cost catalysts, the project will identify sorbent synthesis cost reduction strategies. The sorbent material will be tested with simulated vent/flare-gas compositions in a cyclic pressure range and the sorbent stability will be verified by an assortment of X-ray, spectroscopy, and microscopy methods. Following sorbent development, an ANG tank will be built and flare gas slipstream testing will be conducted in shale gas sites.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to promote and improve the use of high quality video in products that the general public works with every day.  From high resolution auto dashboard cameras, to low latency video streams from flying drones, to wireless laptop docking stations, to higher quality coverage of news and sporting events, to better and faster delivery of video over the Internet, every application requires the high quality, low latency, flexible, power efficient video encoders that will be developed in this project.  The uses of video are increasing every day.  Video instruction manuals are replacing printed instruction manuals.  Video is replacing still images in on-line advertising, social media and billboards.  It is predicted that over 90% of all Internet traffic will be video data in the next few years.  Enabling all these applications requires the latest technology in video compression such as the techniques developed in this project.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project tackles the problem of creating a real time video encoder, using the latest H.265 compression technology, running in hardware on an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array).  An FPGA is a type of chip on which the logic is configurable - it can be programmed to implement any function.  It represents a mid-point between a dedicated integrated circuit, which is very expensive to develop, and can never be changed or enhanced once it is fabricated, and a pure software solution which is very flexible but requires bulky and power hungry equipment (i.e. computers) as an underlying platform.  The research conducted under this grant will devise, test, and implement algorithms that are amenable to realization on an FPGA, that operate in real time, and that yield a high quality result in terms of the visual quality of the compressed video with respect to the number of bits used.  The goal, at the conclusion of this research, is the demonstration of a functional HEVC/H.265 encoder running on an FPGA which has cost, flexibility, power and performance advantages over other encoders.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to transform commercial construction through the democratization of scanning and automation of Building Information Modeling (BIM). Constant design and change management is a unique challenge that is costing the US construction industry billions of dollars annually. In order to prevent such a huge economic loss, this industry is in the path for a digital revolution. BIM is known as the first truly global digital technology that could revolutionize the construction industry. However, BIM usage is currently limited because it is only viable for large-scale projects. The primary reason is that the process is too laborious and expensive. The proposed technology will completely eliminate these barriers. Its ease-of-use, ubiquity of the capturing device, and automated object detection democratizes as-built BIM modeling. Enormous value could be generated due to streamlining and data management capabilities that are offered by the technology in the form of accelerated project schedules, reduced numbers of requests for information and change orders, and timely identified design clashes. This will pave the way to increase the competitiveness of the US construction industry, by enabling new products and services that support automatic BIM modeling.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project investigates the technical and commercial feasibility of an automatic and inexpensive solution for the Scan-to-BIM problem in the construction industry. Scan-to-BIM refers to 3D scanning of a physical structure and converting the captured raw spatial data into an object-oriented, semantically-rich model. Although there are a few technologies that aim to facilitate this process, the 3D modeling component remains primarily a manual and time-consuming task. When using the proposed technology, a non-technical worker videotapes the target structure. The video is automatically sent to a server for processing. A unique videogrammetric 3D reconstruction engine reconstructs the 3D geometry of the structure in the form of a 3D point cloud. It then extracts object hypotheses from key video frames and spatial data in the form of observations. Afterwards, it optimizes a novel coherent joint probability distribution function and infers a 3D layout. The outcome is an object-oriented 3D representation of the structure with embedded geometrical attributes and property sets. The main novelty of this technology lies in a hybrid approach that combines low-level segmentation with high-level space modeling. This advances the state-of-the-art in robust intelligence, particularly the interpretation of complex, unstructured data.

    and an ion-sensitive detector, which is being developed specifically for this
    application.  Lastly, this ion-sensitive detector will provide an opportunity
    to further measure the spatial sensitivity of the retinal implant with high resolution.
    \ These in vivo and in vitro studies are vital for the continued evaluation of
    biocompatibility, surgical feasibility, and efficacy of the implant.  The results
    from these studies will further demonstrate the commercial viability of the technology
    under development."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop an online, fully automated platform for designing high-affinity antibodies for use as potential drug candidates. The success of antibody-based drugs has generated interest in faster and more efficient methods to discover and optimize antibodies. The goal of this project will be to develop and implement a computational method for producing protein sequences of humanized antibodies. This will be achieved by providing software that allows scientists to move some of their initial experiments into the cloud, and achieve results much more quickly by using computational methods saving time and cost for new drug development. In addition, it is anticipated that this will improve the features of antibody-based drug candidates, enhance the success rate of clinical studies, and accelerate the commercialization of new drugs.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop and implement computational tools for designing antibodies that are more effective, have fewer side effects, and have fewer problems in manufacturing. Current computational design methods rely almost entirely on the expertise of scientists iterating between experimental and bioinformatics approaches. An automated, systematic approach will help researchers design better antibodies with desired features in a shorter amount of time. The final platform will allow researchers to incorporate experimental and structural information to develop better drugs by determining which experiments will be necessary, assessing the viability of a potential candidate, and identifying structural features responsible for the molecule?s stability, immune response, and binding properties. The typical antibody design process takes many months and tens of thousands of dollars. With the aid of a computational process, this time can be cut back to the click of a button.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of genetically engineered tobacco plants that produce antibodies for the treatment of individuals infected with the Ebola virus. In the recent Ebola outbreak, a new antibody-based drug was shown to be effective in treating infected patients that was based on a transient tobacco-produced Ebola antibody cocktail called ZMapp (Mapp Biopharmaceutical, Inc, San Diego, CA). Unfortunately, Mapp Biopharmaceutical's supply of antibody was quickly depleted, as the manufacturing method was not able to keep up with demand. The technological innovation in this proposal is the targeted production of antibodies within the gland cells of the tobacco leaf surface structures called glandular secreting trichomes. The research objectives will be to demonstrate the secretion of antibodies to the Ebola virus from tobacco trichome glands. The goal is to generate a line of N. tabacum plants that is optimized for antibody production in plant trichomes to provide a biomanufacturing platform for the large-scale production of antibodies that may be used in the treatment of Ebola infection, and in the future, other diseases.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to use a recently developed plant-based biomanufacturing system to scale-up the production of antibodies to the Ebola virus for use as a therapeutic treatment. Mapp Biopharmaceutical has produced a drug based on antibodies to the Ebola virus produced in a tobacco plant transient gene expression system.  Using this system, they have identified a glycosylated antibody variant (glycoform) with enhanced antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity. Using glycosyl-transferase knockout lines of N. benthiamiana and transient expression strategies, the company utilizes plants to produce glycosylated antibodies that produce optimal recruitment of natural immune effector cells (Olinger et al., 2012). Other expression hosts (Chinese hamster ovary cells, yeast) yield product with reduced potency, and are not suitable alternatives. To recover active antibody with their current plant expression technology, Mapp Biopharmaceutical must destructively harvest plants, and isolate antibody from plant tissue homogenates. Unfortunately, this method has not been able to produce enough antibodies to satisfy the demand.  The proposed method will allow for the production of antibodies in tobacco plants in large scale.  In addition, the proposed system will use antibody harvesting strategies that do not require destructive homogenization as the antibodies will be secreted onto the surface of the leaf, and recovered by washing. The goals of this project are to increase the functionality of plant-produced antibodies, scale-up production, and reduce the costs of production further through system optimization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to address one of the primary barriers to the emergence of flexible electronics -the inability to assembly and interconnect thinned integrated circuits (ICs) onto flexible substrates in a reliable, cost-effective, high volume manner. Flexible electronics has been the subject of many industry journals, trade shows, technical conferences and market research reports. All describe a new age of ubiquitous electronics with devices embedded in the structures and items around us.  Flexible electronic devices, unlike today's devices that are rigid and boxy, can conform to natural, curved shapes that exist in the real world. However, flexible electronics have yet to have their predicted economic and social impact. A major reason is because the electronics industry has not yet found a reliable, low-cost method for assembling thin, flexible ICs onto flexible circuit boards. Today's 'pick-and-place' assembly technology cannot handle ICs thin enough to be flexible. Until a new method is developed and adopted, the potential of flexible electronics will likely not be realized.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the integrated circuit (IC) aspects of a flexible hybrid electronics technology to a level at which these devices can be produced reliably and in volumes in a production-relevant environment. While most of the components of flexible hybrid electronics technology relating to printed electronics methods have been adequately researched and developed, little has been done on the integration of solid-state semiconductor devices onto highly flexible, organic substrates. Partial results have been reported in the literature, however, no attempt has been made to provide a comprehensive, wafer-to-end product approach suitable for commercial applications. This project will address this gap by focusing on all the steps for IC integration, including the preparation for assembly of ultra-thin, flexible semiconductor dies, their attachment onto a flexible circuit board using laser-enabled assembly technology, and their reliable electrical interconnection. The anticipated end results will be a complete flexible hybrid electronics integration technology developed to a level of pilot production readiness.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that it will enable a group of customers we call Risk Pricers (specifically, property and casualty insurance underwriters and mortgage bankers in financial firms) to profit from tailoring pricing on their products. They can do this by rapidly predicting financial losses for buildings having specific configurations, using the software developed in this proposal. These customers can then tailor pricing of earthquake insurance and mortgage terms based on refined analyses that we facilitate. Besides offering a clear financial benefit to Risk Pricers, this new analysis approach will also fundamentally change market forces and incentives around building safety. If a building's owner is incentivized to improve its earthquake performance (via lower insurance and mortgage costs), then high-performance buildings become more appealing and this will encourage design of better buildings. As the company's software makes more explicit the links between building properties and financial costs, society will benefit from more efficient resource allocation, ultimately leading to increased societal resilience.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop algorithms and software tools that provide financial guidance to customers interested in repair costs and closures of buildings due to earthquakes.  To complete the development of its tool, the company will focus on calibrating statistical models to predict displacements and accelerations in a wide range of building types, when they are subjected to earthquake shaking. The company's method for rapid estimation of structural responses utilizes principles of engineering mechanics, but applied in a domain where academic research does not focus (i.e., estimating response of a structure whose properties are not fully known to the analyst). The key identified need is to calibrate a statistical predictive model for the response of a structure that is effective over all popular construction types of interest to customers in the insurance and mortgage banking markets (i.e., light frame wood, steel, concrete, concrete tilt-up). The company will also develop loss metric and calculation outputs that incorporate insurance contract conditions such as deductibles and limits, in order to link the calculations to customers' workflows.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be high performance error correction for flash memory. Error correction plays a critical row in making digital devices reliable. Shrinking semiconductor geometries results in more errors. This has created a special problem for flash memory where the need for more rigorous error correction is approaching a practical limit with the widely used Bose Chaudhuri Hocquengham error correction. Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) is a recognized solution that  can approach the theoretical limits of what is possible. This LDPC based technology can improve lifetime of flash by without the added cost of the existing BCH solution. This technology helps Flash Memory enterprises to use higher density flash to improve storage capacity and cut the storage product costs. Without the superior performance, small size and low power consumption of the LDPC technology, the migration to low cost high capacity flash memories will be seriously slowed. In the absence of a comparable alternative approach, there will be serious limitations on the performance of a vast array of products that depend on highly reliable and economical flash storage.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will use a variety of  techniques to minimize the area and power requirements and enhance the performance of Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) error correction codes for flash memory. Many of these techniques are applicable to a wide range of error correction applications in digital communication and storage from WiFi to hard disk drives. The need for better error correction is crucial for flash memory but there is a widening demand for improved error correction. For example larger memories require better error correction to insure the system failure rate is low. In the next two years the company expects to develop a Verilog version of the LDPC decoder that is easily integrated with a flash controller. The project will work with potential customers/partners to ensure the code works with controllers. In the long run these techniques can be adapted to a wide range of applications as the need for more reliable data continues to rapidly expand.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project can be found across the semiconductor industry with its initial market in wireless communications.  Due to the extraordinary properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), applications include low noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixers, and RF power amplifiers (PAs). Looking forward, carbon nanotube transistors (CFETs) can reshape analog radio frequency electronics, enabling the higher data rates and improved capacity demanded by next generation wireless systems due to their intrinsic linearity and associated low out of band interference . CFETs are highly efficient, dissipating less unwanted power than current state of the art technologies while handling high power levels. This translates into more battery life for mobile devices with lower cooling costs. With more linear RF transistors, many billions of dollars of spending on additional base stations, larger batteries, and radio spectrum can be avoided, at great savings to consumers and industry. More speculatively, the creation of reliable grwoth techniques for CFETs and associated manufacturing processes may offer an excellent sensor platform or better ways to form on chip interconnects. The key problems being investigating of in situ growth of high performance nanotubes are applicable to the fabrication of CNT based devices for many electronic applications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop electronic devices for radio frequency applications using carbon nanotubes (CNTs).  CNTs are a one dimensional material with diameters in the nanometer range. CNTs have unique and highly desirable properties ranging from superior mobility to current carrying capability to thermal stability.  Calculations show CNT amplifiers will be inherently linear with noise suppressed to the lowest possible quantum limit. These properties allow for electronic devices that will perform better than existing technologies, such as silicon and gallium arsenide.  Just as importantly, the cost for making these devices will be dramatically lower due to the relatively simple method for material synthesis and device fabrication. This work will enable wafer scale arrays of high density in-situ tubes to be grown on silicon enabling the development of carbon electronic components a manner comparable to silicon devices. This work will enable cost effective wafer scale growth of devices which exploit the groundbreaking linearity that CNTs can deliver.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project in the long term has two main components.  First, the development has potential to reduce the country's overall energy consumption by funding the development of low cost air quality sensors for energy efficient buildings.  And second, the project will enhance the safety of our natural gas infrastructure with a low cost, low power methane (natural gas) sensor technology.    This work will develop a methane (natural gas) sensor prototype with 10x lower cost, size and power consumption than current solutions.  The proposed methane sensor will meet several currently unmet needs.  These include enhanced public safety by enabling methane leak detection for natural gas distribution systems, and protecting first responders by enabling more and better methane detection in hazardous environments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop the world's most porous materials, Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as a sensing material.  MOFs have been an active topic in material science research for over a decade, but they have yet to find a commercial application.  This project promises to be the first commercialization of this exciting new class of materials.  Nearly 40,000 different MOF structures have been identified to date.  The crux of this work is to use a combination of computer models and laboratory experimentation to optimize a MOF structure that selectively and rapidly absorbs methane gas.  The end goal of this project is to develop a commercial prototype methane sensor 'on a chip' that consists of a solid state mass transducer with the MOF coating that has been tuned for sensing methane.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project can lead to a revolution in the consumer electronics market
    (mobile handsets, tablets, game consoles and wearables), wherein high performance, low power, small footprint
    multisensing (not limited to inertial sensing) platforms with timing devices, are all directly microfabricated on a common
    ASIC substrate. Sensor fusion can produce unprecedented user experiences by using data collected from all sensors and
    processed using machine learning algorithms. This can further boost the sensor and timing markets that are expected to
    exceed $6 billion dollars by 2017. Moreover, the emergent Internet of Things (IoTs) and wearable markets are expected to
    reach $20 billion dollars by 2025, which can induce a rapid growth of such intelligent sensor fusion market. This can have
    a tremendous societal impact as wearable devices and IoT systems, interfaced with mobile platforms, can be used to
    monitor people?s health, safety and energy consumption. Making these solutions affordable will make it amenable to low
    income households not only in the US but also around the world. It will also enable researchers to attain new frontiers of
    knowledge such as in digital sensory systems. The long-term goals are to provide such intelligent sensor fusion solutions.

    This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to demonstrate wafer-scale microfabrication of
    Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) inertial sensors directly on the application specific integrated circuit (ASIC)
    substrates, by using electroplated copper (e-Cu) as a structural material. MEMS inertial sensors, such as gyroscopes and
    accelerometers, are pervasively used in consumer electronics and automotive industries. Current trends are, however,
    requiring higher device performance with smaller footprints, wherein multi-degree-of-freedom sensors are integrated on
    the same package, to enable new capabilities and user experiences. These requirements can be met by monolithically
    fabricating inertial sensors on ASIC substrates, which is complex to achieve with silicon as a structural material. Using e-
    Cu, which is currently used for ASIC metal interconnects, as the structural material, can enable easier routing to
    implement optimized mechanical structures, smaller dimensions given the high density of copper, extremely low cost as
    no wafer bonding is required, smaller form factors, multiple sensors on a single die, and much smaller parasitics providing
    low noise and higher performance. Phase II tasks will be to wafer-scale fabricate an inertial measurement unit that is
    monolithically integrated with its ASIC with optimal performance parameters.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in its ability to implement multiple-input
    multiple-output (MIMO) detectors of any size. This, in turn, impacts the broad needs of wireless
    communications industry that is always in search of more efficient use of the scarce spectral resources.
    Since its invention 15 years ago, MIMO has been included in all wireless standards, e.g. WiFi,
    WiMAX, and LTE. As of today, MIMO products of sizes up to 4x4 (i.e. 4 transmit and 4 receive
    antennas) have appeared in the market, while the most recent standards, such as IEEE 802.11ac WiFi
    and LTE-Advanced cellular, have specified MIMO sizes as large as 8x8. For WiFi this can mean more
    effective hot-spots in public and workplace settings. For cellular this can mean improved connectivity
    in rural areas with fewer base-station towers, having a positive economic impact. Industry activities
    that attempt to build larger MIMO systems such as 16x16 are occurring. Massive MIMO networks with
    more than 100 antennas at the base stations have recently been proposed for 5G cellular and beyond.
    These trends indicate a large market opportunity for the scalable MIMO technology that this project
    builds upon.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase 2 project plans to develop and
    commercialize a set of intellectual property (IP) software-codes/IP-cores related to multiple-input
    multiple-output (MIMO) communications. These cores address the needs of wireless chipset
    manufacturers. The main hurdle in the design and implementation of MIMO systems is their
    complexity which drives cost and power consumption. The complexity of an optimal MIMO detector
    grows exponentially with the number of transmit antennas. The same is true for most of the near
    optimal MIMO detectors that have been suggested in the literature and adopted by industry. This
    limitation has been the main impediment in developing commercial MIMO systems that support larger
    array sizes with increased range and data rate. This project adopts a novel technology that achieves near
    optimal performance having complexity that only grows linearly with the number of transmit antennas.
    It thus can be used to implement MIMO systems of any size, at an affordable complexity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the ability of the haloacetic acids (HAAs) analyzer proposed here to change how superintendents of drinking water utilities go about understanding their drinking water treatment plants. The HAAs analyzer will allow superintendents to continuously map, monitor and then optimize their drinking water treatment practices using detailed and high quality measurements on the federally-regulated HAAs, which are carcinogens. Optimizing of the water treatment practices using the HAAs analyzer will reduce chemical usage (save money) while simultaneously providing the highest quality drinking water for their customers by minimizing HAAs. The commercial U.S. market for Drinking Water chemicals, contract operations, consulting/engineering, instrument and testing is $19.3 billion. The entire U.S. Water industry market is $86.4 billion. The major target of this proposal is the 28,643 traditional community water systems serving 90 % of the U.S. population. Some water systems struggled to meet Stage 1 Disinfection By-Product (DBP) regulations. Stage 2 of these regulations is stricter. The DBP regulations address long-term (decades' timescale) exposure to HAAs. Superintendents can use the proposed HAAs analyzer to understand hourly, short-term variations in their treatment plants to enhance long-term minimization of HAAs.



    This project will commercialize the first state-of-the-art instrument for fully automated, on-site process monitoring of the drinking water disinfection by-products known as haloacetic acids (HAAs). The HAAs analyzer proposed here has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of water treatment through reduction of treatment chemical usage at the water treatment plant while simultaneously improving and stabilizing water quality with respect to the carcinogenic and federally regulated HAAs. Currently, most drinking water treatment plants use contract laboratories to determine HAAs concentrations in the distribution system. This approaches can take 2 - 3 weeks to return the results at a significant expense for the equivalent hourly data provided by the proposed HAAs analyzer. The research objectives for this Phase II SBIR proposal are to develop components for the HAAs analyzer to enable long-term, maintenance free operation with minimal operator intervention. Simultaneously, costs will be reduced for both construction and operation of the HAAs analyzer to establish commercial feasibility. The anticipated results will be a HAAs analyzer that will provide water treatment personnel individual and Total HAAs concentrations once per hour, on-site and automatically.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to continue the development of a family of new nanostructured conductive additives for use in high-performance coatings and composite resins. Static charge buildup from the environment is a critical problem in a number of vehicular applications, which increasingly utilize lightweight components constructed from non-conductive plastic or composite materials.  Static charge buildup interferes with electronic components, such as distributed sensors, so that mitigation of this effect is essential for safe vehicle operation. The design of lightweight vehicles using composite materials, which requires high-performing antistatic coatings, will lead to large reductions in fuel consumption and carbon emissions in transportation.  In 2011, emissions from transportation accounted for 28% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Modern aircraft designs, utilizing composite materials, show more than 20% reduction in fuel consumption compared to traditional vehicles.  Imminent increases in fuel efficiency standards in automobiles will also drive manufacturers to adopt the use of composite materials. The development of the proposed antistatic coatings is essential to enabling these new lightweight material technologies.

    The new additives are based on the synthesis of self-assembling nanostructures from conductive polymers and structure-directing agents. When successfully incorporated in commercial paints and primers, the conductive properties of the coating are enhanced without compromising adhesion and durability. In this Phase II effort, we will further optimize these additives, based on key customer requirements, and develop a plan to scale up their production tenfold with reduced waste and production time.  Corrosion properties for marine applications will also be evaluated, and the product portfolio will be expanded to address follow-on applications.

    explore the applicability of a Gabor-domain optical coherence microscopy (GD-OCM)
    instrument to image and evaluate optical materials as part of the manufacturing
    process.  The immediate broader impact of this project is to effectively provide
    both qualitative and quantitative information about product quality in manufacturing,
    with an initial focus on contact lens manufacturing. Providing high-speed, industrial,
    micrometer-level resolution in all three dimensions, GD-OCM enables contact lens
    manufacturers to replace multiple inspection steps with a single measurement done
    automatically, reducing the opportunity for damaging the samples and human error,
    and ultimately leading to increased productivity and yield.  The resulting improvements
    in contact lens performance and extended wear effects are poised to have a positive
    impact on a significant percentage of the population.  Recent evaluations of GD-OCM
    have indicated its ability to provide a new wealth of characterization methods
    for quality control of various materials that are otherwise impossible to characterize
    nondestructively, including gradient refractive index polymers, glass and layered
    structures.  Additionally, GD-OCM will enable new advances in a wide variety of

    of a variety of material types. \n\nThe objective of this Phase II project is
    to establish the effectiveness of the emerging GD-OCM technology for nondestructive
    on-line metrology of contact lenses in manufacturing. Quality control and detection
    of product-significant defects, and a corresponding increase in production yield,
    represent the value proposition for the introduction of GD-OCM instrumentation
    into the contact lens production environment. The project will result in two major
    outcomes: 1) implementation of a robust production-environment instrument to effectively
    provide micrometer-level resolution in all three dimensions and quantification
    of yield-relevant contact lens quality metrics not previously available in a single
    instrument; and 2) demonstration of the technology for inspection in a production
    environment to rapidly and accurately monitor defects and quantify contact lens
    quality using product relevant metrics. This nondestructive, on-line optical inspection
    system can have significant impact not only on the process control and thereby
    yield of contact lenses, but also in manufacturing of layered materials in general,
    including polymers, plastics, and glass. Longer-term, the technology offers new
    paths for tissue imaging, guided surgery, and monitoring of eye disease."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to allow a greater number of organizations,
    businesses, and individuals to access shortwave infrared (SWIR) imaging technology.
    Modern SWIR technology has existed for more than 40 years, but its expense has
    limited its use to the military and large corporations; this project is grounded
    in the belief that when everyone has access to SWIR technology, the benefits to
    society are exponential.  SWIR image sensors have potential applications in food
    safety analysis (e.g., identifying harmful adulterated foods and revealing sub-surface
    flaws in produce), manufacturing (e.g., sorting), security (e.g., night vision),
    medical sensing (e.g., vein mapping and blood oxygenation monitoring), and the
    automotive field (e.g., night/inclement weather vision systems and for self-driving
    vehicles). A low-cost sensor will open the SWIR imaging market to players in these
    fields who have so far been shut out due to price. In addition, a low-cost, high-quality
    sensor will also make SWIR imaging directly available to the general public for
    the first time ever in the form of a SWIR camera smartphone add-on, establishing
    a new market for SWIR imaging. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
    Phase II project will produce low-cost germanium (Ge)-based shortwave infrared
    (SWIR) image sensors with features superior to those of currently available SWIR
    sensors. The research objective is to resolve issues of resolution, power usage,
    size, and sensitivity that limit advancement in the SWIR imaging field. This project
    will address these problems by utilizing a unique Ge-based SWIR sensor structure.
    In addition, a monolithic method of integrating the image sensor material onto
    the Si readout integrated circuit will be pursued. This will enable precise alignment
    of the readout integrated circuit  and the imaging device, which will lead to
    smaller pixel size and better resolution. Finally, issues of power use and sensitivity
    will be addressed through an innovative structure called Gate-controlled Charge
    Modulate Device. Research will focus on refining and improving the fabrication
    processes necessary to reliably produce low-cost, high-quality Ge-based SWIR image
    sensors."

    II project is an effort to cross the chasm between fundamental new physics insights
    relating to the structure of matter and an aggressive approach to commercializing
    'Semiconductors of Light' in an emerging market for high density optical interconnects
    priced for datacenters. Until recently, the only known photonic bandgap solids
    were photonic crystal structures consisting of regularly repeating, orderly lattices
    of dielectric materials. It was generally assumed that crystal order was essential
    to have photonic bandgaps. This longstanding assumption is now known to be false.
    New photonic bandgap structures, characterized by suppressed density fluctuations
    (hyperuniformity), include disordered structures that are isotropic. This means
    that light propagates the same way through the photonic solid independent of direction
    (which is impossible for a photonic crystal). While the layout of waveguides in
    conventional photonic crystal  and quasi crystal photonic bandgap materials is
    tightly-constrained to follow characteristic crystal axes, the layout rules for
    hyper uniform disordered solid waveguides have no such fundamental constraints.
    The universal protocol and highly-efficient computational framework covering the
    full range of photonic crystal, quasi crystal , and hyper uniform disordered solid-based
    photonic bandgaps will be generalized to a broad class of critically important
    photonic components by the application of a powerful new gradient-free optimization
    methods."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project are both technical and economic. The developed error-correction solutions will enable flash-memory-based devices to have higher capacities, higher reliability, and faster speeds at lower power while driving down the cost. This will have a major impact on mobile computing capabilities and enterprise storage by improving the efficiency and reliability of data centers, servers, and mission-critical storage that incorporate flash memories. Improved enterprise storage boosts the efficiency and growth of IT businesses, e-commerce, and financial trade. The solutions will also enable reduced power consumption and heat dissipation leading to greener systems.  The benefits of the error-correction solutions are also applicable to the hard disk drive and communications industries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and validate novel low-density parity-check (LDPC)-based error-correction for flash memory-based solid state drives (SSDs). SSDs are rapidly being deployed for both enterprise and consumer storage due to their fast speeds, low power, and low heat dissipation. But they bring numerous technical challenges stemming from the fact that reducing flash memory cell sizes leads to an unavoidable degradation in the reliability. With a trend of increasing die density to enable higher storage capacities, the industry is swiftly moving towards adopting LDPC codes to provide more powerful error-correction. However existing LDPC solutions use complex post-processing and multiple reads to bring down the error rates to the desired levels which lowers the read speeds, making them unattractive for future SSDs.  Novel binary LDPC-based solutions will be developed for a range of parameters, and validated in hardware.  The design method will be extended to develop new non-binary LDPC solutions which provide even greater reliability enhancements, leading to greater endurance in SSDs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aligns with a major shift in healthcare to reduce hospital acquired infections. At a cost of over $1.5B and 600,000 extra hospital days in the US alone, surgical wound infection in high-risk abdominal surgery patients is a major healthcare burden. In addition, providers and hospitals face greater scrutiny of their wound infection rates today, and the sweeping changes of healthcare reform have incentivized these critical stakeholders to invest in preventative solutions. However, currently available solutions are insufficient, and existing surgical device companies have not developed a compelling pipeline of products to address this unmet need. The proposed technology enjoys a competitive advantage in that it operates in a relatively open competitive landscape, and its unique mechanism of action provides a comprehensive wound protection strategy. Thus, this technology has the potential to make a significant worldwide impact on wound infection, both from a healthcare quality and commercialization standpoint. The initial market for this technology is in colorectal surgery, with ample expansion opportunities into other abdominal surgical markets totaling over $1 billion.


    The proposed project seeks to develop and commercialize a novel technology designed to prevent one of the most frequent, morbid, and costly hospital-acquired infections: surgical wound infection. The technology is an innovative surgical tool that provides a comprehensive anti-contamination strategy for the wound that is also user-friendly for the surgeon. This device has the potential to be a transformative innovation in the quality of surgical care, particularly in the 3.5 million patients undergoing high-risk abdominal-gastrointestinal (GI) surgery in whom wound infections are the most common. The technology also allows surgeons to experiment with a variety of approaches to identify ?best practices? for intraoperative wound care. This Phase II project proposes three main objectives. First, the company will refine the scientific understanding of the local and systemic therapeutic of the anti-contamination therapy through numerical modeling and pre-clinical testing in a porcine model in order to provide clinical use recommendations. Second, the company will design and develop a product sized for laparoscopic surgeries in order to support a broad-based commercialization effort. Third, the company with develop scaled manufacturing capability to support commercial release of the CleanCision product platform.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project derives from an enhanced capability for automated processing of free text and other structured data.  Motivation for this approach comes from neural networks and, in turn, it has applications to neural modeling and our understanding of how the brain processes information.  In the software industry, commercial innovation continues to revolve around automated processing of web pages, which plays a key role in creating many new companies.  Therefore, the ability to automate decision-making from free text is increasing in importance. A better way to represent text for use with machine learning will open new capabilities wherever the structure of sentences must be taken into account.  This has the potential to lead to new startup ventures, thereby resulting in new products and services. A successful project will result in platform technology that can provide a substantial competitive edge to companies that take advantage of it, provide new and better capabilities for consumers, and help advance the nation's lead in technological innovation.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to further develop new ways to process textual material so that computers can better learn applications related to natural language.  Applications include sentiment analysis (assigning either positive or negative views to a body of text), summarization of documents, and classification of documents using multiple labels from a fixed set of many classes.  The project will further develop new techniques to improve performance, and prototype components for transforming text and applying computerized learning methods. The new techniques represent words simultaneously with document structure using a single high-dimensional vector (for example, a list of 1,000 numbers).  The project is aimed at improving computational capabilities involving documents, web pages, and other text as well as providing new techniques that can be applied to automated translation, better computer understanding of images, and genomic information.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from lowering the barrier to entry for, and simplifying the use of, cloud computing systems via a novel, open source, cloud platform.  The proposed advances have the potential to facilitate and expedite innovation and technological progress by a diverse software and global developer community, enabling more people to tackle the important yet increasingly challenging and data-intensive computing problems facing businesses today. The company's technologies address directly the key pain points of this explosively growing platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and cloud-based application development market - namely privacy, lock-in, and control.  Unique to the company's approach is compatibility with a leading, proprietary, public cloud PaaS standard (Google App Engine).  As such, the company's solutions have significant commercial potential because they are directly applicable to businesses that employ App Engine today (there are currently over 4.5 million active applications), and they lay the groundwork for addressing the larger PaaS market in the long term.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is based on a distributed system that executes and manages web-based and mobile cloud applications (apps) via automation, thereby relieving developers, operations staff, and Information Technology (IT) groups of the burden of doing so.  The proposed technology advances address the issue of vendor lock-in - i.e. the use of proprietary technologies, services, and systems that effectively prevent users from switching to alternative vendors.  In the cloud space, lock-in is proliferated through the use of (i) proprietary interfaces and tools, (ii) complex pricing models, and (iii) the lack of interoperability across vendors.  The proposed technology disrupts lock-in by public cloud vendors by automating software deployment and management across clouds, and by making it easy to move applications and data between vendor offerings and on-premise clusters. In particular, the company's technologies abstract away the complexities of cloud use, and provide monitoring, backup/restoration, and migration of applications and data across clouds at the push of a button.  By providing features that are currently unavailable today, the proposed technologies have significant potential for reducing the cost, risk, and learning curve associated with cloud-based development, deployment, disaster recovery, and migration for the next generation of cloud applications.

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is aimed at reducing the impact of knee arthritis and improving the quality of life for those suffering from this debilitating condition, while simultaneously strengthening the bond between academia and industry by providing students with unique research opportunities through the development of a novel Total Knee Replacement technology.  Over 600,000 total knee replacement procedures are performed annually, comprising 8% of all Medicare spending.  Total hospital charges for this procedure approached $40 billion for 2012.  The revision rates for this procedure are significant: 10% at 10 years and 20% at 20 years.  Considering the aging population of the United States, the number of total knee replacements and revisions are steadily increasing and the majority of these will be completed under Medicare coverage.  The primary cause for revision surgery is loosening of the implants.  This innovation aims to develop an anchoring method for implantable orthopedic devices that will reduce the total number of revision procedures performed by creating a more stable interface between the bone and the device, and therefore enhance the scientific and technological understanding of orthopedic implants in general.

    The proposed project is a device that utilizes structural engineering principles such as load transfer and truss design to improve osteo-incorporation of a total knee replacement implant; such a device is likely to be more efficacious than current designs.  Currently available systems suffer from significant revision rates after being implanted only a short while.  With younger patients receiving these implants, devices need to be developed that will give the mobility and quality of life required by these patients.  The novel web structure fixing the tibial tray of a total knee replacement into the bone should provide improved initial fixation, reduce micro-motion, and eliminate aseptic loosening, all of which contribute towards a reduced revision rate and improved patient comfort.  After using the information gained from the Phase I SBIR investigation to inform computational models, the design of this device will be finalized.  The device will then be subjected to rigorous mechanical testing to investigate its performance in vivo, while simultaneously serving to satisfy the testing requirements mandatory for FDA approval.

    the ability to perform rapid whole-genome engineering in industrial yeast strains.
    Current technologies to engineer cells for specific functions (e.g., chemical
    or fuel production) are inefficient, expensive and extremely time consuming. Multiplex
    Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE) is a disruptive technology that provides a
    powerful platform to engineer microorganisms at tremendously reduced cost. Until
    recently, MAGE was limited to a laboratory strain of E. coli, possessing key genetic
    features that enable MAGE. Recent advances have allowed us to port MAGE to yeast,

    existing industrial yeasts with the capacity to undergo MAGE. The goal is to improve
    MAGE efficiency in yeast by developing a high-throughput system to rapidly create
    and quantify strain variants for their capacity to undergo the MAGE process itself.
    This project will establish a system to identify and optimize the requisite genetic
    features for MAGE in yeast, in order to rapidly engineer industrial yeast strains

    target validation, screening, and optimization. Included in this effort are several
    significant first-to-market capabilities such as chronic dosing capability in
    freely-moving, tether-free mice and high-throughput evaluation of multiple new
    drugs through automation. The controlled delivery of agents, including emerging
    biologics, siRNA, peptides, and small molecules, is an important capability in
    a multitude of clinical and preclinical research applications including neuroscience,
    pharmacology, toxicology, and physiology. More importantly, this project will
    enable drug studies that to be performed in a manner that will facilitate and
    enhance the translation of candidate therapies from animal to human."

    positron emission tomography (PET) imaging products to manage neurodegenerative
    disorders, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. PET is now a key diagnostic and
    management tool in oncology, and compounds labeled with [18F]-fluoride provide
    optimal signal to noise ratios and resolution in medical imaging applications.
    Ground Fluor Pharmaceuticals (GFP) developed proprietary single-step fluorination
    technology that allows [18F]-labeled medicines to be prepared efficiently from
    cyclotron-produced [18F]-fluoride. Under this Phase II research project GFP will
    apply its new technology to produce the imaging agent 6- [18F]fluoro-L-DOPA (FDOPA),
    a compound useful in diagnosing Parkinson's disease and in cancer imaging, that
    is not currently readily available because of the difficulty in its production.
    GFP will scale-up and manufacture pharmaceutical grade ALPDOPA (GFP's precursor
    to FDOPA) under pharmaceutical cGMP conditions, and offer this material for research
    studies and for clinical imaging. GFP will develop an FDA drug master file and
    will provide technical and regulatory assistance to cyclotron pharmacy customers
    adopting GFP's technology for commercial production of FDOPA. In addition to helping
    to bring this valuable imaging agent to market, GFP will assist academic and pharmaceutical
    research groups in the development of new [18F]- fluorinated imaging products.
    \n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential is to expand the scope and utility
    of PET as medical diagnostic tool, thereby improving treatment and management
    of serious medical problems. Although [18F]-fluoride possesses, perhaps, the most
    advantageous properties for imaging, is relatively inexpensive, and is widely
    available, it is difficult to incorporate into medicines for imaging. GFP has
    developed a general enabling technology that uses the relatively inexpensive and
    widely available form of [18F]-fluoride to create new molecular imaging agents
    to advance personalized medicine. This technology, and the compounds it creates,
    will provide the physician with new opportunities to diagnose, assess, and more
    efficiently treat unmet medical needs. The manufacturing technology developed
    here is a broad platform applicable to the preparation of a wide range of new
    imaging agents. The commercial potential of PET imaging is significant; the worldwide
    market for PET is expected to grow to $15 billion by 2015."

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will determine the technical feasibility and the commercial value proposition for high temperature, highly processable fiber optic coatings across a range of markets to include fiber lasers, fibers for oil and gas, avionics fiber, and medical fiber. Tetramer will perform research to modify the structure of polymer coatings to provide enhanced performance which will extend the capabilities of current fiber optics. Coatings developed will advance our understanding of structure property relationships and establish new boundaries for the polymer system. During this program, Tetramer will synthesize new monomers and polymers and evaluate their properties for use as fiber coatings. At the end of this program, Tetramer anticipates it will have developed 3 new types of polymers with a set of performance characteristics which are not available from any one single material today. New fiber coatings will be developed which are capable of operating at temperatures above 300 deg C, having greater processability, and for laser applications, having lower refractive indices.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will impact society in many ways due to the various markets in which the coatings can have a meaningful impact on the optical fiber performance. Fiber optic lasers are quickly becoming the preferred method for laser fabrication. By enabling fiber lasers to operate at higher temperatures, fiber lasers will immediately see increased output powers and longer service lifetimes. With applications in industrial metal working (welding, cutting, and engraving/marking), micromachining, and medical devices, doubling power output via improved coatings will have a major impact across many industries. Higher temperature fiber coatings will improve down-hole drilling and the overall efficiency of oil drilling operations through better temperature monitoring in deep wells. This has the potential to lower prices of oil and increase oil production. Additionally, these fibers can aid in geothermal well monitoring which would provide a green source of energy. The coatings under development have the potential to generate increased revenue and profit throughout the value chain through increased performance of products and enhanced market sizes through enhanced capabilities. Tetramer will also use this Phase II program to train undergraduate and graduate level students from nearby Clemson University

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the technology research and development necessary to bring wireless instrumentation and smartphone technology used for feedback to lower-limb amputees about their real-time performance, for rehabilitation in situ. The intellectual merit of the proposed research lies in the opportunity to transform the field of rehabilitation and to advance healthcare by enabling a fundamental shift toward low cost, ubiquitous rehabilitation that can be used away from the clinic. This proposal will research and develop the pre-market alpha- and beta-prototypes of an instrumented insole, smartphone app, and HIPAA-compliant data transfer and remote server storage and analysis system, as an essential and transformative tool utilized for physical therapy and gait training outside of the clinic. While sensors have become small, inexpensive, and highly available, many research lab applications are limited to proof-of-concept evaluations that involve tethered systems and/or post-processing of the data. This research quantifies the effect of this low-cost, personalized, wireless assistive technology that can be used away from the clinic. Ultimately, this work lays a foundation for more complex rehab feedback systems, e.g. using a smartphone to detect gait and provide feedback to an orthotic or prosthetic for muscle stimulation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes the focus on mobility limitations in persons with lower-limb amputations, which affect twice as many minorities as Caucasians. The commercial potential of this wireless assistive technology is vast: with diabetes as the major contributor to amputations, the number of amputees is forecast to triple to 3.6 million by 2050. The knowledge gained can be expanded to impact individuals with a wide variety of mobility limitations, e.g. stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, etc. The orthopedic market ? 773,000 total hip/knee replacements performed annually in U.S. ? is also commercially relevant, as patients must affect an asymmetric gait following fracture repair or joint replacement to reduce weight-bearing on the healing limb. Another significant group are athletes seeking to improve performance or recover from injury through precision gait analysis and real-time feedback. In this Phase II proposal, this research will quantify the effect of this wireless assistive technology by enabling persons with amputations to use individualized proprioceptive feedback and to participate in the design of the personalized feedback methods. This work will enable a wealth of information collected away from the clinic, including a way to investigate how and whether patients follow treatment protocols.

    (VR) and desktop experience focused on fostering STEM (science, technology, engineering,
    and math) and robotics interest in young people. The project's intent is to address
    the growing skilled labor shortage in STEM fields and prepare learners for the
    cross-industrial rise of robotics. Through exposure to experiential STEM learning,
    the project will create a groundswell of student interest and aptitude that will
    help close STEM workforce gaps in the long term, as well as plant the seeds for
    a future cohort of robotics professionals. The project's hypothesis is that its
    game-based VR-enhanced learning platform can reliably instill design/engineering
    thinking skills into learners while exceeding the capabilities of existing educational
    tools in terms of scalability and adaptability to student needs. The project is
    additionally intended to drive K-12 VR hardware adoption by providing a compelling
    and teacher-customizable solution that will justify institutional hardware investments.
    When proven scalable, the project will act as a beachhead for other VR and game-based
    learning entrants to bring their own innovative learning content into the K-12
    ecosystem, simultaneously promoting the progress of science in alignment with
    the NSF's mission, as well as providing a broad economic lift to the American
    economy by unlocking a new market sector. \n\nAs a VR-first experience, this project
    will provide students with a first-of-its-kind immersive robotics sandbox that
    allows for hands-on experimentation. Players will be able to form hypotheses,
    build robots, test, and iterate, mirroring the processes of project-based robotics
    and maker programs. Beyond robot construction, the project will offer challenge
    courses that test players' ability to build to specification. Each course will
    require a different physics-based solution for which a capable robot must be constructed.
    For example, a course might challenge players to navigate a set of stationary
    obstacles and then place a cube on a pressure plate, requiring a robot with maneuverability
    and the ability to pick up, transport, and place objects. This task serves as
    a model of the underlying dynamics of engineering design: identifying a problem,
    thinking critically, and developing a solution engineered specifically to that
    problem. To establish this project in the larger context of teaching media, it
    will be developed as a desktop-only intervention, a VR-only intervention, a desktop/VR
    hybrid intervention, and a paper-based control intervention. These variants will
    be tested with middle school and high school end users to verify the efficacy
    of game-based VR as a pedagogy.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a comprehensive physiological monitoring platform that provides individuals working in hazardous occupations, such as firefighters, with longitudinal and real-time physiological monitoring that includes predictive diagnostics. Because existing physiological monitoring products are cost-prohibitive for most fire and emergency service agencies, and 50% of firefighter deaths are due to sudden cardiac events, this technology offers fire-service agencies an affordable mechanism for addressing this critical problem. Multiple studies have shown that early detection of an irregular heart-rate event (arrhythmias) offers a significant advantage in preventing and treating further CVD. The proposed technological innovation would consist of a wearable physiological monitoring device, which will use a range of networking mechanisms to communicate with a user-friendly analytical platform. Further, the integration of a self-alert system into a wearable patch would support a standalone operation even if there were to be a communication lag between a firefighter and command center. Early detection of arrhythmias and promoting corrective actions could reduce each individual cardiovascular disability claim by about $325,000.

    The proposed project aims to reduce the economic and social costs associated with firefighter injuries and fatalities due to underlying cardiovascular-disease and the extreme physiological strain resulting from the hazardous occupational environments in which fire services personnel work. The affordability of the proposed technology would not only improve occupational safety in the industry, but also enable scientists to further scientific knowledge about the interrelationships between oxygen saturation, ECG values, and extreme heat and physiological stress by using this technology to conduct experimental and field-based research. The longitudinal analysis possible with this platform would also give scientists the tools necessary to research the relationships between physiological stress and human performance factors, to gain a deeper understanding about critical factors in mechanisms such as decision making, risk perception, and communication. These factors are frequently cited in National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) after incident investigations of firefighter fatalities, along with playing important roles in the operating procedure standards set by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a new class of soft, flexible, nonabrasive sensing elements which provides precise temperature readings to positively impact the health and mobility of diabetic patients. The principle impetus of this research is to focus primarily on advanced diabetic patients who suffer from nerve damage to their feet. These patients cannot feel their feet, leading to two important and related results. First, they are at high risk for an increased number of undetected ulcerating injuries from tissue damage produced by walking (friction) or standing (pressure). Second, since these injuries are undetected and unfelt, there is a decreased urgency by the patient to seek medical care. Delays in medical intervention further exacerbate injuries and complicate treatment, leading to an economic burden associated with foot ulceration estimated at $15 billion annually. More importantly, the 5-year mortality rate after first ulceration (40%) approaches mortality rates from heart failure (50%). The key need for a simple and cost-effective ulcer-prevention paradigm is a safe, easy-to-use foot monitoring system with temperature-sensing capability with a remote readout.

    The proposed project utilizes an innovative approach to develop a non-invasive sensing system that will provide the ability to constantly monitor skin temperature that would be integrated into a diabetic-friendly insole. Skin temperature has been shown to be a predictive indicator of foot-ulcer development and can additionally be used as a measure of wound healing. A simple system enabling early detection of imminent skin ulceration subsequently reduces further tissue damage, decreasing limb amputations and saving financial, medical and emotional resources. The proof of concept shoe insert is designed to reside daily in a patient's shoes to continuously record the patient's foot health. In addition, the software system, including a mobile app for users as well as a doctor dashboard, is developed as a communication channel between the patient, the healthcare provider and the caregiver.

    tutoring system that both assesses and improves the behavioral readiness and social
    emotional skills of Kindergarten and 1st grade students. Research has shown that
    early intervention for children with social skill deficiencies is critical for
    success in the classroom and success in life. Children from vulnerable, underserved
    social niches are particularly likely to be 'less ready' for school, including
    those who experience poverty, family instability, and trauma, each of which disproportionately
    impact children from racial and ethnic minority groups. The game being developed
    by this project empowers educators to provide that much needed social emotional
    learning support for their young students. First, it provides an affordable, feasible,
    and scaleable means for identifying the social emotional needs of young students
    as they transition to formal schooling. Second, it enables educators to quickly
    translate this formative assessment data into personalized, digital intervention
    that can be applied with K1 students on a much broader scale than is possible
    with traditional, in-person services. And lastly, because this innovation is game-based
    and fun, students are more likely to fully engage and fully benefit from the embedded
    instruction. \n\n\nThis project will advance understanding of how an Intelligent
    Tutoring System (ITS) can be used effectively to help educators provide social
    emotional instruction to all students. Within academic domains such as science
    and mathematics, many successful ITS implementations have employed learning models
    where answers to problems and the knowledge being evaluated can be easily represented.
    However, traditional ITS techniques have not been as effective in domains like
    social emotional learning, where the connection between what a student does and
    what the student knows is less well-defined. This project will develop several
    significant innovations for ITS that apply to social and emotional learning, but
    may also be useful in other, less well-defined learning domains. These innovations
    are represented by our adaptive Student Model and Tutorial Manager which collectively
    enhance student learning via personalization, pacing, and engagement. As more
    student data is collected, the student model will become increasingly accurate,
    leading to more intelligent choices from the tutorial manager to better enhance
    the social tutoring of our innovation and thereby, student learning. In addition
    to addressing significant societal and market needs, research findings from this
    SBIR will be published to more broadly inform the efforts of the ITS community.\n\nThis

    This SBIR Phase II project will enable the development of the first known commercial medical ultrasound device utilizing air-coupled Capacitive Micromachine Ultrasound Transducer (CMUT) technology to diagnose otitis media. Otitis media is the number one indication for which antibiotics are prescribed for children, and the number one cause for surgery in childhood, costing $15+B annually in the US and resulting in 30M annual doctor visits in the US alone. Clinical studies show a diagnostic error rate averaging 50%. Today's tools are unable to accurately determine the presence, and much less the type, of effusion in the middle ear. This leads to significant over- prescription of antibiotics, over-referrals to specialists, and unnecessary surgeries. OtoNexus Medical Technologies, Inc. is developing a simple and sensitive medical device to provide diagnostic data to quickly and accurately diagnose both presence and type of otitis media.

    The work of this project will establish fast and economical assessment of CMUT sensor manufacturing performance, by electrical and acoustic measurements. OtoNexus will design and construct test systems to rapidly evaluate electrical and acoustical performance of CMUT sensors as an assessment of production quality. The Electrical Vector Impedance (EVI) test fixture provides an electrical surrogate measure for acoustic output, which can be performed rapidly at the wafer-level with 100% sampling. The Acoustic Output Measure (AOM) test fixture evaluates the pressure emitted by CMUT, and other acoustic performance parameters, after speculum final assembly. This project will develop test fixtures, methods, and processes for assessing production reliability and process consistency. The OtoNexus ultrasound device will be marketed to pediatricians and other primary care physicians, and will decrease prognostic uncertainty and resultant over-prescription of antibiotics, and place the tools for more accurate diagnosis into the hands of the very first clinician the patient sees. This will reduce costs by decreasing both antibiotic usage and specialist referrals and will also decrease required physician time by enabling a nurse or other physician extender to perform the test for otitis media.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a suite of screen-printed receive coils for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), that are flexible, lightweight, low-cost and adapted to the entire population from infants to adults. MRI is widely used to establish a broad variety of clinical diagnosis, but suffers from long examination times and a high rate of failure, resulting in a yearly loss of more than $4 billion in the United States alone. Printed receive coils are extremely flexible, lightweight, and conform well to the human body. With this technology, coils can be designed and manufactured inexpensively to fit all patient sizes, thus improving image quality and enabling robust acceleration of the method. These benefits can contribute to increase the success rate of MRI exams, speed up procedure time, enhance the clinical workflow, and reduce equipment costs. Printed coils will improve the quality of care offered by MRI suites and increase the availability and use of MRI to a wider patient population. Overall, this project will develop a clinical-ready system capable of delivering the full economic and clinical benefits of printed coils, which will contribute to a reduction of the healthcare costs associated with MRI.

    This project aims to fully realize a clinical-ready system consisting of a collection of printed, flexible lightweight MRI coil arrays, and connecting to a single universal cable to interface with the MRI scanner. A first part of the project will focus on the design of the cable and the associated connection scheme allowing interchange of multiple printed coil arrays of different sizes. Different strategies will be examined with the intent of maintaining high performance and safety while maximizing the advantages brought by printing. A second project goal will focus on the development of a collection of printed coil arrays for patient sizes ranging from newborn to adult, that are compatible with the universal cable and for both 3T and 1.5T scanners. The arrays will be designed for body imaging and will consist of 32-channel devices divided into 16-channel posterior and anterior portions. Their performance will be compared to a commercial 32-channel product. The final system will meet all the safety requirements for medical use and will be ready to be manufactured at scale.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will develop a new tool for the analysis of in situ indican precursor in indigo plants, which when combined with genomic analysis and genetic linkage mapping in selectively bred indigo crops, will lead to high indican yielding breeding parental lines and ultimately competitively price natural indigo dye.  Additionally, characterization of genetic markers will accelerate further crop improvement by understanding and harnessing the genes crucial to indican synthesis and other aspects of significance to overall indigo yield. These advancements will benefit customers, denim mills, by leading to a more reliable, lower cost plant-derived indigo supply. The success of this multiphase STTR project will enable a cost-competitive, cleaner, and more sustainable denim dyeing process, while greatly expanding the market for domestically produced natural indigo.  Commercialization of a more consistent and higher yielding US-grown indigo plant that produces high purity indigo powder can replace the current standard of synthetic, imported indigo powder. While in demand by the marketplace today, plant-derived indigo is currently only used in premium denim products due to the high cost per pound resulting from low yields per plant per acre. The direct result of this research will be to open new market segments and expand existing market penetration for US-grown and manufactured biobased indigo for the textile industry, an addressable market of $1.86B. The methods and technology developed through this project have a direct path to the commercial marketplace and the industry is ready to support biobased textile dyes such as plant-derived indigo.

    During this project, reference genome resources will be constructed for indigo feedstock crops, F1 mapping populations will be constructed for P. tinctoria, I. tinctoria, and I. suffruticosa varieties, and design of the handheld rapid assay device will be validated through laboratory analysis. The reference genome for I. suffruticosa will be built using Pacific Biosciences SMRT sequencing and assembly.  In addition to this reference genome, whole-genome resequencing will be performed on available I. suffruticosa and I. tinctoria varieties.  Nucleotide variation and variant effect prediction will be made between the Indigofera-based indigo varieties.  This variation will be used to develop markers to evaluate intervarietal crosses. Controlled greenhouse crosses of three species will be made to create F1 mapping populations for use in constructing a genetic map and linkage mapping, in combination with the resources developed.  Intraspecies varieties exhibiting distinct phenotypic traits of commercial interest or notable dye yield differences will be selected for crossing to generate the F1 populations. Results from laboratory-based fluorometry equipment will be evaluated for efficacy and then compared against extractive indigo dye analysis from the leaf biomass.  A final prototype will be constructed based on these findings and validated through use in the laboratory and in the field.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project can lead to a revolution in 3D microgeometry and reflectance properties measurement of object surfaces at the micron-scale range. The proposed technology will significantly improve photorealistic rendering in digital prototyping, and therefore reduce the waste from using physical material samples during design, engineering, and manufacturing. This technology will help reduce product development time and cost, and lead to a greater sustainability.

    The proposed project will develop a computational imaging system that allows for high-resolution 3D microgeometry and reflectance properties measurement of object surfaces. The current approaches for 3D surface measurement at the micron scale are based on sophisticated optical and mechanical components that are expensive and can be difficult to use, and most of these approaches cannot capture the full appearance of a surface, such as diffuse reflection, specular reflection, and surface roughness. The goal of this research program is to develop a combination of hardware and software that can measure 3D surface microgeometry and reflectance properties with micron-scale accuracy. The proposed technology is expected to achieve superior performance at greatly reduced cost.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is multilayered. First, there is the potential for creation
    of a carbon nanotubes manufacturing industry in the United States that will create
    hundreds of high-paying domestic manufacturing jobs advance U.S. leadership and
    knowledge in industrial electrochemistry. Secondly, Saratoga Energy's technology
    has the potential to benefit the United States economy by increasing the cost-competitiveness
    and performance of lithium-ion batteries, paving the way to the broader adoption
    of electric vehicles and grid/renewable energy storage. In turn, this will help
    reduce the strategic importance of oil, the cost of securing global oil supplies,
    as well as greenhouse gas emission. While lithium-ion batteries are the focus
    of this body of work, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are also used in a variety of other
    applications - advanced composite materials, nanotechnology, catalyst supports,
    water filtration, and other areas of commercial impact. \n\nThis SBIR Phase II
    project proposes to 1) electrochemically characterize carbon nanotubes as a cathode
    conductive additive for high-performance lithium-ion battery applications and
    2) construct a small pilot-scale carbon nanotube manufacturing unit capable of
    producing 1 kg of product per day for retail distribution. Saratoga Energy Research
    Partners, LLC (Saratoga Energy), has developed a high-selectivity electrochemical
    process to convert carbon dioxide into carbon nanotubes. In the work conducted
    thus far, Saratoga Energy has established that its carbon nanotubes can be manufactured
    at a cost ~50X cheaper than the market price for state-of-the-art battery-grade
    carbon nanotubes.  Battery manufacturers use carbon nanotubes to enable the reduction
    of conductive additive content in the cathode, thus improving specific and volumetric
    energy density. Carbon nanotubes also act as a reinforcing agent in the electrodes
    improving their mechanical properties. This is important for the battery assembly
    process but also for battery life performance, as the carbon nanotube network
    maintains a high level of cohesion of the electrodes upon repeated charge-discharge
    cycles. However, today, the high price of commercial carbon nanotubes limits their
    use, which will be addressed by our lower cost CNTs.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's
    statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
    the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be observed through a direct reduction in
    the energy consumption required by large industrial facilities, commercial buildings,
    campuses, and homes. Due to reduced cooling demands as a result of carefully designed
    radiative properties, the sustainability of federal and industry facilities will
    be significantly improved with the installation of passive radiative composite
    (PRC) roofing material for building energy management. The market demand for cool
    roofing materials has exceeded $1 Billion, annually, and is expected to grow with
    increasing need and return on investment. PRC roofing material can expect to compete
    in a growing industry due to non-trivial improvement over state-of-the-art options
    in commercial cool roofing products and the economic fabrication method identified
    in the PRC conceptual design stage. Opportunities extend beyond structural thermal
    management to a variety of cooling needs including refrigerated transportation
    and storage. The development of PRC roofing will advance understanding and use
    of spectrally-selective materials designed for intelligent control of thermal
    radiation. \n\nThe proposed project will provide critical design, testing, and
    experimental validation needed to transition PRC technology into the commercial
    sector. Designs based on electromagnetic and thermal modeling include composite
    material options capable of providing passive radiative flux of over 100 Watts
    per square meter of installed material. This passive cooling advantage, relative
    to current commercial cool roofing materials, is expected to create significant
    long-term cost savings and reduction in fossil fuel usage for climate controlled
    structures. PRC material properties designed to be spectrally selective offer
    the opportunity for intelligent thermal management through reflection of solar
    and near-infrared portions of the radiative spectrum, while emitting strongly
    in the 8-13 micron atmospheric transmission window. A primary objective of the
    SBIR project is to optimize PRC designs considering full spectrum properties with
    three criteria in mind: thermal efficiency improvement, durability, and large
    batch manufacturing economy. Demonstration of PRC-based roofing materials on full-scale
    test structures will quantify passive cooling power and robustness to weathering,
    positioning PRC-based roofing for introduction by a commercial manufacturing partner.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable vast deployment of energy storage to increase installation of renewable energy for reduced pollution and greenhouse gases, to improve energy security, and to improve energy efficiency and safety. The project will realize a dramatic reduction in cost and size of Energy Storage Systems (ESS) that will allow penetration of ESS into markets served by fossil fuels. One key market is grid ancillary services which includes Frequency Regulation (FR) that regulates grid frequency and stability. With the potential of this project, the FR market for battery based ESS is expected to grow from $100M/yr to over $4B/yr. This project has the societal benefits of replacing fossil fuel based ?peaker? plants that are commonly used to perform FR, with clean Li-ion battery based ESS. Furthermore, by providing lower cost FR capability for the grid, the project will enable grid penetration of more renewable energy, which requires additional FR capability.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a highly compact integrated modular inverter/energy storage system to revolutionize deployment of energy storage system for grid, micro-grid, energy efficiency, and energy reliability support. The development effort proposed here includes an advanced energy storage system consisting of an extremely compact 150kW high frequency 3-level inverter, an integrated 100kWhr compact Li-ion battery system, proprietary battery management systems and internet communications capability. This will provide a highly integrated and scalable 150kW Energy Storage System with an integrated battery string inverter with 60% reduced system cost and 10X reduced size that will open new markets for energy storage and renewable energy. The project will develop key technology innovations which work together with advanced Li-ion batteries to form a revolutionary new product. These innovations include: high frequency 3-level inverter with innovative high frequency control and output filter to achieve >10X reduction in volume; a novel topology that integrates inverters into each cell string and eliminates many components resulting in 60% system cost reduction; a modular and scalable design that is fault tolerant and allows easy optimization for multiple system uses.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to transform the lives and future economic opportunities of young people and their communities through democratized access to cross-curricular computer science, engineering, and cybersecurity education. Daily life, economies, innovation, and national security all depend on having a strong and skilled STEM workforce. For this workforce to exist, our schools must provide the necessary education and experience to prepare students for such careers. Unfortunately, a vast majority of K-12 educators today are not equipped with the resources to do so successfully. The importance of solving this problem cannot be overstated; developing a plentitude of competent STEM professionals is critical to ensure economic and security stability. These project goals are aligned with NSF?s mission to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; and to secure the national defense. The resulting technology innovation is of potential service to more than 50 million primary and secondary school students and 3.5 million educators nationally, with an ability to impact their course of study, improve STEM outcomes, increase hands-on project-based experience, and improve future economic opportunities.


    This technology innovation emerges at the intersection of cloud-based software technology, real-time collaboration tools, and learning management systems. This reimagined technology tool easily connects, attracts, and fosters delivery of cross-curricular, educational computing literacy resources aligned with national and state educational standards. The project aims to empower and support educators and students in tackling the many new opportunities and growing number of resources in computer science (CS) and engineering education at home, in classrooms, and in community centers. As the CS education landscape evolves with new and exciting technical curriculum, this innovation analyzes the willingness of educators to create or adopt new computer science education, the effectiveness of real-time collaboration tools on CS education outcomes, and measures student awareness and feelings about computer science and engineering disciplines. This technology innovation promotes customer participation and a unique ability to provide support at the ground level in real-time. There are solutions that provide massive online CS courses and curricula; however, none targeting K-12 classrooms or educators which support and integrate cross-curricular computer science, engineering, and cybersecurity education. Offering cloud-based, synchronous technology tools this technology enables real-time, expert mentoring and pair-programming in a K12 virtual learning environment on a massive scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to increase overall crop health and production with the proposed smartphone compatible crop health sensor. More specifically, crop disease remains a significant threat to global food security, and with the ability to perform pre-visual screening, the proposed platform enables cost efficient, quantitative detection of crop disease, empowering farmers to take action to reduce disease impact. Initially the sensor platform provides a timely solution for cost effective, high throughput, and pre-visual screening of citrus Huanglongbing disease (HLB), enabling citrus growers to effectively manage HLB in their groves and remain profitable. The pre-visual, cost efficient and quantitative detection capability also translates to detection of diseases in other crops. In addition, the sensing technology developed can be used for quantitative assessment of crop nutrient and water stress, enabling farmers to optimally manage crop health, providing a means to optimize profits, increase crop yields, and reduce environmental impacts. This is critical to ensuring national and global food security, and protecting national water supplies by reducing eutrophication of water bodies due to misdiagnosis and mistreatment of crop stressors.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is built upon Atoptix?s patented compact self-referenced spectrophotometer design, which reduces the size and cost of an optical spectrophotometer to enable field use and integration with smartphone technology. For each spectral measurement, the sensor simultaneously records a self-referenced spectrum, retaining the sensitivity and reliability generally reserved for costlier and bulkier spectrophotometer designs, but also enabling a non-technical user to collect data in the field at the push of a button. Distinct from surface reflection methods, the proposed sensor enables pre-visual detection of a pathogen, as it only captures light that has penetrated inside of a leaf and interacted with internal structures. By lowering the cost of the optical sensor through patented designs, increasing ease of use via a smartphone, and joining the precision of optical spectroscopy with machine learning based analytics, the proposed sensor can enable widespread adoption by growers in disease prone regions, where community wide screening is key for protecting grower assets.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project addresses the need to reduce the time associated
    with conducting tests currently used to establish targeted antibiotic (and dose)
    to treat infections.  Sepsis and septic shock are one of the leading contributors
    to death in US Hospitals, responsible for 250,000 deaths annually (estimated at
    30-50% of all hospital deaths).  To combat these high death rates, time is of
    the essence.  The administration of targeted (versus broad-spectrum) antibiotic
    therapy in the first five to six hours of septic shock increases the likelihood
    of survival by roughly fifty percent.  This project combines electronics and microchannel
    fluidics to rapidly obtain results on antibiotic susceptibility.  The project
    requires engineering, software development, and method development, resulting
    in an instrument that utilizes disposable cards to conduct the testing.  The resulting
    product will allow transition from broad spectrum to targeted antibiotic therapy
    faster (1 day - weeks), leading to major benefits: (1) patient outcomes are greatly
    improved by faster transition to directed antibiotic therapy; (2) Reduced hospitalization
    stays (reduced intensive care stays), resulting in significant monetary saving
    for healthcare systems (estimated at a cost savings of at least $3.75B annually).
    \ (3) Reduced broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy reduces the current fostering
    of antibiotic resistance in healthcare settings globally. \n\nThis project uses
    Microchannel Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (m-EIS) to measure the \"bulk capacitance\"
    (Cb) of a suspension. Cb is a measure of the amount of charge transiently accumulated
    at the membranes of living cells in a suspension. Cell proliferation results in
    an increase in Cb, whereas cell death results in a decrease.  Using m-EIS to measure
    bacteria in the presence of candidate antibiotics and doses, is robust, sensitive,
    and extremely fast, determining, in real time, cell growth, stasis, or death (in
    approximately 4 hrs).  This project will develop a rapid, direct-from-sample,
    inexpensive commercial system. This is achieved by using commercial MNPs to isolate
    microorganisms from clinical samples such as blood culture broth, urine, sputum
    etc., and re-suspending the pathogens in specified volumes of growth media to
    obtain a suspension containing optimized concentrations of bacteria.  Pathogen
    growth or death is then monitored using m-EIS in microfluidic cards where they
    are exposed to a range of antibiotic concentrations. The result is a phenotypic
    antibiotic susceptibility (AST) profile, yielding the minimal inhibitory concentration
    (MIC) of multiple candidate antibiotics within 4 hours of sample collection. The
    AST and MIC information is then used to treat infections with targeted therapeutic.
    \ The first products utilizing this system/method will focus on urine and positive
    blood culture broth samples.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
    has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual
    merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will extend to a number of applications, including smart buildings, home automation, and security. The development of this new technology for efficient indoor sensing, and development of new algorithms for occupancy sensing and counting techniques, will have immediate implications in the building automation and home construction industries, where improved occupancy sensing is necessary to achieve the promise of Smart Buildings that adjust environmental conditions such as lighting and air conditioning automatically to suit the needs of the occupants. Implementing this false-alarm free technology will realize millions of dollars in cost savings from reduced energy use. Such energy savings would impact the US energy independence while helping to cut greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to "smart building"/energy efficiency applications there are also significant opportunities to apply these highly-reliable and difficult-to-defeat sensors to facility security, military, law-enforcement/correctional facilities and in-home care monitoring. This project represents Broadening Participation: As a woman-owned minority business in an underrepresented geographical location (Hawaii), the success of Adnoviv will bring opportunity for graduate students through our relationship with the University of Hawaii and encourage young girls to enter Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) related fields.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project will result in a revolutionary advance in occupancy sensing for smart buildings and energy-use reduction by providing a low-cost sensor capable of real human presence detection and occupant count and eliminating the issues that have limited the utility of occupancy sensors in many applications. The feasibility of using radio frequency Doppler radar to detect human cardiopulmonary activity and estimate number of occupants using a low power system-on-chip (SoC) platform will be demonstrated. In particular, reliable occupant detection without false alarms, and occupant count estimation will be investigated to further enhance energy savings potential, especially in conjunction with heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) loads. The significant commercial potential of such True Presence Occupancy Detection Sensors in energy-saving applications will be demonstrated in partnership with one of the largest building automation companies in the world.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will address two societal needs. It will enable mass charging infrastructure for electric vehicles (EVs) at minimal cost, and will enable the provisioning of energy services to help integrate renewable energy
    sources. This is critical as electricity generation and transportation together consume close to two-thirds of all US energy and emit more than half of all US greenhouse gases. To drastically reduce greenhouse gases will therefore require electrification of our
    transportation and renewable generation of our electricity. California (CA) has a mandate to have 1.5 million zero-emission vehicles by 2025 and, currently, half of the nation's EVs are in CA. If the project is successful, the proposed technology, when deployed at scale,
    can potentially save CA $144M annually in operating costs and $1.1B in capital cost when CA reaches its ambitious goal by 2025. This can help reduce greenhouse gases annually in CA by 5.5 million metric tons. This project will therefore make an impact in both clean
    transportation and clean energy.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will develop an adaptive EV charging system that can implement a number of innovations that are not currently available in the EV charging industry. It will offer a site host a solution to recover costs,
    jointly optimize onsite distributed energy resources such as solar panels and battery banks, minimize operating cost for site host and charging cost for drivers, and optimally trade off preferences and constraints of different drivers and of the site host, subject to
    infrastructure capacity constraints. These technologies will be based on unique real-time sensing, communications, and control capabilities, as well as advanced optimization and learning algorithms. These technologies will provide a target charging capacity at minimal infrastructure and operating costs, as well as a platform for energy services to the grid.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is to allow for the recycling of valuable materials from
    complex wastes that today cannot be recovered. The commercial impact from this
    innovation is to allow for complex waste streams that contain multiple materials,
    such as textiles, to serve as the source of raw materials for the manufacture
    of new goods in a way that is cost advantaged. This gives those businesses that
    use such raw materials a sustainable alternative and importantly, a lower-cost,
    efficiently produced material. In this way, there will be significant incentive
    for the reuse of thousands of tons of material that today either goes to landfills,
    oceans, or is incinerated for energy, a very low value application. A funded,
    successful project will yield an entirely new framework for recycling of complex,
    multi-component materials.    \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop
    novel technologies for fractionating complex wastes. Multi-component wastes such
    as textiles represent upwards of 4% of total landfill volume. Today, there does
    not exist technology for recovering the high-value materials that are in these
    wastes. The proposed project intends to develop a new approach using chemical
    techniques as opposed to simple melt recycling to enable the value-added recycling
    of high value polymers from such wastes. Chemical process development will take
    place in order to take the current status of the technology to implementation
    in a pilot plant. The main technical objective of the proposal is to develop the
    process so as to produce large amounts of consistent, high purity product. Materials
    such as polyester and nylon cannot be separated from natural or cellulosic fibers
    such as cotton or other textile materials. The goals of the research are to develop
    the proposers' current process for fractionating the synthetic resins with an
    emphasis on achieving high purity products at larger volumes. To this end, various
    chemistry and chemical engineering techniques will be investigated for exclusion
    of impurities from end product polymer at the kg scale.\n\nThis award reflects

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to lay a foundation for vehicle to infrastructure communication focused on applications that add direct value to mobility. Many solutions are focused on getting information to the vehicle, while it is often the infrastructure that requires vehicle information to operate more efficiently. Currently, traffic signals enforce the right-of-way of everyone regardless of in-vehicle technology. This is why optimizing their effects on the road network can provide tremendous benefit. There are significant benefits to transit as well, like buses and light rail that, when given priority at intersections, improves on-time performance which is a major factor in ridership rates.

    The proposed project advances the work of the joint standardization of the National Transportation Communications for Intelligent Transportation Systems Protocol (NTCIP) to achieve interoperability between various traffic signal controller vendors to enable shared control and organization between different operating agencies. It is not unusual to have sections of roadway be managed by local, county, and state within the same small area. These overlapping jurisdictions produce fractures within the road network resulting in the asynchronous timing of traffic signals. The aim is to consolidate the management into a signal network capable of coordinating large areas of traffic signals to increase mobility's overall efficiency. With a cloud solution that is capable of speaking to each networked intersection, vehicle telemetry data and route information can be used to proactively optimize signal timing. Working with prioritized vehicles such as buses, fire trucks, and ambulances, pilot studies will be conducted to perform priority and preemption along routes that cross jurisdictions. Each pilot case will be analysed based on key performance indicators set forth by the agencies.

    This SBIR Phase II project will benefit society by reducing the cost of manufacturing biologic pharmaceuticals and improving their quality, including pharmaceuticals that are currently too costly to manufacture because they target relatively small patient populations. In order to accelerate the availability of newly discovered drugs, the pharmaceutical industry and federal regulatory agencies have identified a great need for advances in process analytical technologies (PATs) in biomanufacturing. This project will advance state-of-the-art PAT by providing a continuous in-situ sensor enabling novel methods of drug quality assurance. This multi-analyte sensor will allow biopharmaceutical companies, for the first time, to monitor the concentration of the product in-situ as it is being produced along with the concentrations of other important cell culture conditions. This ability unlocks new avenues for optimizing biopharmaceutical production which consumes about 35% of the biologic drug cost-of-goods. Efficient control of upstream processes using sensors such as the one proposed here is expected to reduce these costs by up to 30%. Furthermore, this technology can be directed towards other analytes by replacing the bound affinity ligands. Thus, this technology can be used as a sensing platform in biopharmaceutical manufacturing or medical diagnostics, food processing, and water quality monitoring.

    This project will advance scientific knowledge of biosensing, hydrogel chemistry, and process analytics by developing the first continuous monoclonal antibody (mAbs) sensor suitable for biomanufacturing. Remarkable progress has been made in developing affinity ligands that specifically bind to targets, but thus far the primary application has been medical therapeutics. This project will develop a biosensor adapting affinity ligands, aptamers in particular, for the first time for application in bioprocess monitoring. This will be accomplished by synthesizing the first antibody-responsive hydrogel containing covalently attached peptide aptamers. Each of the four objectives will focus on hydrogels, electronics, software and system validation respectively. The mAb biosensor will be capable of monitoring quality and yield of mAbs besides the key parameters: pH, osmolality, glucose, and lactate in cell culture environments. This novel hydrogel will be the basis for the first in-situ bioreactor sensor for real-time antibody measurements during biomanufacturing. This adaptable technology can be leveraged towards a number of protein targets; thus, this project represents a transformative approach that will advance scientific knowledge of biosensing across a multitude of applications. Thus, the proposed sensor array will be a powerful tool to advance process analytics and biomanufacturing.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a personalized learning environment for guiding students in effective use of educational sketching in Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM). There is an estimated need for 1 million more STEM professionals in the U.S. over the next decade. However, the dropout rate for students in STEM majors ranges from 48% to 69%. Recent reform in mathematics education in the U.S. has focused on sketching and modeling so that students have a better understanding of the problems they are solving rather than rote memorization. Sketching is also important for improving the ability to visualize three dimensional shapes in engineering, medicine, and science. Teaching sketching has been shown to increase retention in STEM by over 50% among students entering college with low spatial visualization skills, especially among women and other underrepresented minorities. However, the traditional method of sketching on paper requires teaching expertise and classroom time, which has limited its use. Our touchscreen software will improve upon sketching on paper, by providing immediate feedback and intelligent hints when students are stuck. A key advantage of our approach is that it can reward persistence by having students retry a sketching assignment until they get it right, as opposed to multiple-choice questions that can only be tried once. Impact will include improved conceptual understanding in K-6 mathematics and STEM education at all levels.


    This project will develop an intelligent learning environment where students can freehand sketch on a touchscreen phone, tablet, or computer. They will receive personalized feedback based on the sketches they draw to improve their conceptual understanding and promote persistence. The software algorithms developed will automatically grade student sketches and provide hints that are just enough to keep the student engaged but not so much as to give away the solution. An expert teacher knows that developing skill and increasing persistence requires that students struggle a bit as they overcome obstacles to learn new concepts. The algorithm for interpreting student sketches and providing hints will mimic an expert teacher looking over the shoulder of the student. By interpreting student intent in their sketches, the algorithm will be able to distinguish between intentional marks and unintentional ones that are due to poor coordination or sloppiness. Subject areas include elementary school mathematics, spatial visualization for 7-12th grade technical education, post-secondary vocational and engineering programs, and eventually physics, geology, medicine and other STEM areas. This project will replace sketching on paper and pencil with widely available touchscreens, and make educational sketching more effective and engaging.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a drug delivery technology to address the unmet need of antiproliferative drug delivery below-the-knee. In the United States, there are 323,000 new critical limb ischemia (CLI) patients each year. CLI is the most severe stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD), atherosclerosis of the lower limbs. Ultimately, 40% of CLI patients will undergo lower limb amputation as a result of CLI, half of whom will then die within a year. Existing technologies have failed in these vessels, resulting in higher rates of patient amputation. This project will create a better intravascular drug delivery tool to treat PAD patients after angioplasty. This improved drug delivery will provide three key societal benefits: 1) reduced costs and greater efficiency when revascularizing the vessels of critical limb ischemia patients, 2) a reduction in healthcare costs by reducing repeat procedures, and 3) improved patient outcomes resulting from improved drug delivery achieved using image guidance. If successful, this technology may improve patient health while reducing treatment costs for millions of patients around the world. This will also improve understanding of what aspects of CLI treatment are most effective by offering the flexibility to vary different aspects of drug delivery. When completed, this project will enhance the understanding of intravascular drug delivery with ultrasound and microbubbles.

    This project will provide strong technical innovation through a new ultrasound drug delivery device and new methods to evaluate cardiovascular drug delivery devices. Using a combination of intravascular ultrasound and drug loaded microbubbles, this project will provide better localization of delivery with lower drug doses. This project will then evaluate the drug delivery platform using realistic models of human disease from donated tissue combined with routine techniques (histopathology) and more recent advances (microCT) to evaluate the effect of the disease on drug delivery. The core research objective of this project is to deliver paclitaxel to human diseased arteries with the new intravascular ultrasound and microbubble drug delivery platform. It is anticipated that this project will result in an improved drug uptake over the existing technologies in diseased arteries where drug uptake is poorest. The data and techniques from this project will be used to compel adoption among interventionalists and to validate the the drug delivery system as a tool to prevent amputations in CLI patients.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes development of berry post-picking screening and handling that will provide a safe and efficient way to remove contaminated berries from the processing stream of an automated harvester. The project will advance machine vision technology for robotic harvesting and will be a key enabling technology leading to acceptance of automated harvesting as safe and effective. The market sector addressed by this project is strawberry farmers, though the technology will be applicable to other types of fruit and vegetable farming as well. The automated harvesting technology advanced by this project will alleviate chronic and worsening labor shortages faced by strawberry farmers and will ensure that strawberries remain affordable and available to consumers. Filling the need created by farming labor shortages is a $1 billion business opportunity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop new vision processing and inspection methods vital to enabling use of an automated, robotic strawberry harvester. Acceptance of automated harvesting technology by strawberry farmers hinges on the ability of the harvester to remove bad berries from the plant without allowing the undesirable berries from entering the harvester packaging stream and potentially contaminating large quantities of berries. To achieve this, it will be necessary for the harvester to identify and eliminate diseased, rotten, damaged, or infested berries at multiple stages in the stream from automated picking to final packaging. The classification method that identifies the berries to be eliminated will be extremely accurate, with a very high detection rate and a low false alarm rate. The methods developed will be suitable for installation on a farming machine that is subject to a harsh outdoor environment as well as the shock and vibration environment found on a robotic harvesting device. New handling processes will be developed that will allow automated inspection of the entire berry without damaging the fruit or creating a risk of cross contamination from infected berries, significantly advancing the state of the art for automated strawberry processing.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop and commercialize a transparent, thin multifunctional coating for corrosion and biofouling prevention on coated surface. Its environmentally friendly product will be an efficient ready-to-use single component product that can be applied with ease, and would dry in ambient conditions without the need for external heating equipment. The global annual expenditure to mitigate corrosion is in the range of $2.5 trillion, roughly equal to 3.4% of the world's GDP. Protecting assets from corrosion is, hence, a critical requirement for all the industries. A broad range of applications can benefit from this coating technology such as aviation industry where removal of toxic chromium compounds from coating procedures is of high priority, automobile manufacturing where extended corrosion protection to vehicles without using toxic treatments is constantly sought, structural engineering where providing long life protection to bridges is always needed, marine engineering where protecting ships from corrosion and not contributing to ecological imbalance is long sought, military where minimizing the maintenance downtime of tanks and guns is of prime importance, hospitals that are interested in longer lasting medical implants, and paints and coating industry that is desiring removal of volatile organic components from their paints and coatings. The proposed coating is expected to offer scratch resistance and oleophobic characteristics in addition to corrosion protection. The initial success of this project will result in two high-volume products.


    This project aims to develop a specialized single-part, ready-to-use, nominally bioceramic liquid coating for protection against corrosion and fouling activities. On application over desired surface, this transparent liquid transforms into hard-yet-flexible coating. This thin coating composition consists of in-place generated nanoparticles of organometallic compounds in the 3D network of polysilsesquioxane. The reactivity of the precursor to coating is designed such that material can react with substrates in ambient conditions and dries to solid film without the need of any external heating. The hardened coating adheres to most surfaces including metals, ceramics, plastics, glasses, and wood. The optimum thickness of coating is approximately ten microns and can impart various desired surface functionalities to the coated object. In this project, efforts are directed towards optimization of current composition to be compatible with broad range of commercially available topcoat materials. The optimized coating composition will be subjected to a rapid properties screening before third party testing, validation and approvals. An extensive field testing will be conducted in collaboration with potential customers. This innovative coating technology will initially result into two products that can be used in place of carcinogenic hexavalent chromium compounds that are currently in use for the corrosion protection of metals. While one of the products would act as a corrosion prevention compound that can adhere to commercial topcoat paints, the other would act as self-cleaning coating to prevent biofouling activities.

    This STTR Phase II project supports standards-based math education in elementary school classrooms with a hands-on technology intervention. Research has shown that many elementary teachers suffer from low confidence and limited subject content knowledge in math and struggle to develop instruction designed to meet or exceed common core math learning goals. Teachers and researchers alike seek new approaches to engage students and improve teacher effectiveness to improve learning outcomes. The primary goal of this project is the development of a flexible, user-friendly, hands-on robotics kit with associated curriculum and support for teachers, that will engage students in learning math content, align with core curriculum, and measurably increase student achievement. The commercialization of this research-based classroom kit will enable school districts to adopt active learning into their math pedagogy. Ultimately, this promotes the NSF mission to increase national prosperity through science innovation by improving math preparation for students across the United States and preparing them to participate in careers that drive the advancement of science and technology.


    The core contribution of this work is composed of a flexible hardware kit to enable active learning within the core elementary curriculum as well as more traditional maker activities, and a suite of apps that allow students to use this kit to learn specific math content while also providing options to learn computational thinking through general purpose programming apps. To accomplish this, the team employs a proven design process in which hardware, software, and curriculum are simultaneously designed to align to learner goals, evaluated in classroom studies, and iteratively refined. The kit will combine the ease of use and simplicity of a regular snap-together style electronics kit with the flexibility of a programmable microcontroller. The apps developed for this project will build on a new math-based paradigm for robot programming. These math-oriented apps will remove the barrier of programming skills for elementary teachers and students alike when using the electronics kit for math instruction. Simultaneously, programming apps will enable open-ended explorations of making and computational thinking. Another contribution of this project will be the testing and analysis of the hardware system and complementary math curricula. Formative evaluation will enable exploration and understanding of novel mechanisms for learning math, and evaluation of the program's efficacy will enable characterization of the impact on student outcomes in math achievement and attitudes towards math.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a video-based safety system for improving
    the quality and reducing the cost of dementia care. Alzheimer's Disease (AD) affects
    5.4M in the US, including 1 in 9 over 65 and 1 in 3 over 85, and represents two
    thirds of all those affected by dementia. It is the single most expensive disease
    in the US ($236B direct; $221B indirect costs). The size of the US population
    with AD doubles every 15 years. The drug failure rate for AD is among the highest,
    currently 99.6. Fall accidents account for 26% of all AD related hospitalizations
    and are a major concern and key cost contributor, with an average fall rate of
    4 falls per year and 3 in 4 repeated falls. Unfortunately, safety products developed
    for falls were developed for cognitively aware adults and not designed specifically
    for individuals with AD. The proposed system will change the quality of care and
    operations in memory care facilities, increase quality of life for patients and
    families, and help the medical profession gain a better understanding of dementia.
    \n\n\nThe proposed project addresses this critical gap in Alzheimer's care by
    detecting safety critical events, based on camera video where events can be reviewed
    by a human assistant in real-time and after the fact. It is expected to achieve
    two main objectives that advance science and technology: (1) Demonstrating the
    ability for our machine learning algorithms to automatically perform safety critical
    tasks, by learning over a sufficiently rich set of data. These extend existing
    methods for fall detection to include (a) fall prediction; (b) wandering detection;
    (c) bed sores detections; (2) enabling the Company to demonstrate that the system
    proposed can run with a fully operational HIL paradigm running at scale with up
    to 1000 patients in 100 memory care facilities.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory
    mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will usher new Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) products delivering high accuracy with explainability. Without rationale behind predictions, decision makers can't trust and effectively use AI/ML solutions.  Outcome of R&D through this project would lead to more accurate and faster detection with appropriate explanation of anomalous interactions and recommend effective controls to 1) eliminate billions of dollars of fraud, waste and abuse (FWA) in Health Insurance  markets;  2) lower costs, improve quality and speed of Health Care delivery to consumers; and 3) promote new markets in Personalized Health and Smart Health sector for  emerging Medical Internet-of-Things (IOT) devices and systems, enabling economic growth.  The results of this research are expected to enable the discovery of medical anomaly together with advancing the detection of new types of FWA. The boost in detection accuracy with explanation will save hundreds of millions of dollars. Societal impact includes reduced costs to consumers and taxpayers through better FWA control and advance health outcome through early medical IOT anomaly detection. More broadly, the system is expected to detect possible opioid or substance abuse epidemic cohorts, under/over-medication, advanced alerts for community health anomalies.

    The proposed project will extend and generalize a novel machine learning method to solve the Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA) problem in health insurance, coupled with explanatory capability providing rational behind predictions and operationalized in a distributed parallel computing framework for scaling. The technical problem is how to combine relations between entities (e.g., doctors) with their attribute (e.g., a doctor's prescription history). This project advances the state of the art by combining relations between rows in the training data (e.g. doctors) with standard machine learning to improve prediction accuracy while facilitating local explanation. The result is vastly improved prediction accuracy with explainability. Thus, the method uses network information to fill in the gaps of entity information alone and vice versa while facilitating explanation for a test case. This method is expected to significantly improve the ability to detect FWA and pave ways for multi Billion dollars savings, call out IOT-based medical anomaly in advance to improve health outcome and build trust in the predictions for the decision makers through the explanations provided. The team intends to deliver not only the accuracy boost with explainability, but a fully operational system with automated data pipeline, parallel and distributed algorithmic processing framework which can be deployed on a SaaS basis or an enterprise solution.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be that this research will address the resolution and detection range requirements of autonomous driving in complex environments such as urban scenarios. The next major revolution of transportation is undoubtedly autonomous driving, which will increase safety, mobility and productivity. Fully autonomous transportation may eliminate human error, the leading cause of traffic accidents, and could also lead to reduced traffic congestion, higher energy efficiency, and enhanced mobility for the aging and disabled population. The proposed advanced sensing system with intelligent algorithms is expected to help enable and advance the autonomous driving revolution. The proposed effort will also have great commercial impact. The global market size of autonomous sensors is expected to grow from $5.2 billion in 2018 to $11.9 billion in 2023, with the radar-based sensor segment representing $2.9 billion in 2023. In addition, the expected research outcome may lead to advancements in a number of important market sectors including wireless communications, sensing, mobile internet, assistive technology, and additive manufacturing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project aims to realize a 3D-printed Luneburg lens-based high performance automotive radar for autonomous driving. Existing automotive radars do not have enough distance detection, field of view, and angular resolution for classifying and locating dense targets, which is critical for achieving fully autonomous driving. As a result, current autonomous driving tests utilize LiDAR ((Light Detection And Ranging) systems which are more expensive and less reliable than radar especially under adverse weather conditions such as rain, snow, fog, and smoke. Compared to conventional manufacturing techniques, this project utilizes 3D printing, which is convenient, fast, inexpensive and capable of implementing millimeter wave Luneburg lenses. Based on the Luneburg lens?s ability to form multiple beams with high gain and broad bandwidth, a novel automotive radar will be designed by mounting radar detectors around the lens. Moreover, with the wide bandwidth and natural beam forming capabilities of the Luneburg lens, an adaptive sensing approach is proposed to improve the scanning efficiency and avoid interference from nearby or intruder radar systems. With these proposed approaches, the objective is to achieve a high performance and high value millimeter-wave sensing system suitable for autonomous transportation applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on using analytics and technology to benefit patients who require additional care to fully recover - or simply to maintain their health - after being discharged from the hospital. Whether subacute or community-based care, significant opportunity exists to leverage machine learning, decision science, and advance data mining techniques to better support patients. State and federal budgets cover the costs of care for millions of Americans every year. This expenditure is growing faster than inflation, prompting the development of both optional and mandatory payment reform efforts that stand to simultaneously reduce costs and improve care outcomes. If successful, this project will help reduce costs of care for healthcare providers, payers, and government/society.

    The proposed project aims to incorporate and improve upon user-centered decision science in healthcare. The proposed platform will combine advanced machine learning techniques with a patient/family-centered business model. The innovation will harness multiple streams of healthcare data, such as claims/billing data from acute, subacute, and community care settings. If successful, this research will impact the state-of-the-art in healthcare analytics and outcomes measurement.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will continually refine and move towards production of this project's Creative Maker Tool, an augmented reality experience where the act of playing is inherently inventing. The system uses modern technology to avoid digital screens. Throughout this experience, learners tap into their natural proclivities to make and shape ideas in the non-digital world, and develop the ability to fluently construct new ideas in a technical medium. The commercialization of this project will address two, nationally important issues. First, by scaffolding young learners through progressively bringing their ideas into reality, this project will foster creative confidence: the natural ability to come up with ideas and the courage to act on them. Next, there is a gender gap in innovation and entrepreneurship in the United States. Women patent at 40% the rate of men, only 9% of information technology related patents have one or more female inventors, and only 8% of the beneficiaries of incubators meant to commercialize innovations were women. This project will address gender equity issues in the maker community (currently 80% male) and by widening pathways to engage in making.


    The system is composed of a projection system that allows real-time programmable interactions between everyday and virtual objects without a computer screen. Throughout this research, we will create and refine STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics) Apps, which are built-in augmented activities where users create small inventions with everyday objects to code interactions and affect program flow or gameplay, develop Augmented Tutorials, bridge seamlessly to existing STEM tools through real-time interfacing, as well as manufacture and prepare the system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that if successful, the results of this project will revolutionize large area LED array assembly manufacturing, leading to unprecedented growth of the direct view LED display market. Direct view LED displays, or video walls, are becoming more ubiquitous in everyday life. First only appearing in sports stadiums, they have gradually started appearing in retail advertising, and now are starting to appear in cinemas and control rooms. These types of displays are much brighter, have better contrast ratios, faster refresh rates, and are more energy efficient than other competing display technologies. Despite these advantages, rate of adoption is very slow, limited by the cost and time required to make these displays. Current manufacturing tools are facing a bottleneck as display resolutions increase. A massively parallel assembly technology could drastically increase production speeds while reducing cost-of-goods. Additionally, the knowledge gained by the research into this self-assembly technology has the potential to unlock new opportunities in semiconductor packaging including lighting and concentrated solar.

    The proposed project seeks to speed-up the LED placement process by leveraging the parallel nature of directed self-assembly. Rather than placing individual LEDs into a grid-array as it is done today, this technology utilizes confining magnetic fields to quickly and simply arrange hundreds or thousands of LEDs into a neat and ordered grid-array. The objective is to achieve assembly speeds at least 5 times faster than conventional tools. The research will focus on the effects of LED size and geometry on accuracy, rate, and yield. Additionally,  new magnetic field stages to enhance assembly precision will be developed. The key anticipated results are (1) a system that will be able to rapidly assemble thousands of LED die with the precision necessary for high-resolution displays and (2) a fully operational LED display panel constructed with this technology to demonstrate the manufacturing potential of this technology.

    This SBIR Phase II project will create an industrial process for bonding ceramics to metals at the molecular level. Attempts thus far have not been successful in creating robust bonds due to incongruities of the materials being bonded. The objective of this project is to develop a sophisticated, computer controlled, automated bonding machine that will rapidly and safely impact-bond net-shaped ceramic carbides to tool steel in configurations that were previously not available. An automated bonding machine will allow for a cost-effective way to rapidly produce high quality near-net or net-shaped parts. It is expected that as this simple method is popularized, new opportunities for design configurations will be realized in multiple industries; as single parts can take advantage of the properties multiple material, such as the strength and wear resistance of ceramics, with the properties of another, such as the light weight properties of aluminum. Engineers may incorporate cheaper, lighter, stronger, and multipurpose material parts into new product designs. For instance, many new ceramic and metal bonded parts may be fabricated for the automotive, aerospace, chemical, defense, excavation, and nuclear industries. This project will ultimately result in the creation of U.S. manufacturing, sales, and engineering jobs as the mass production of ceramic and metal bonded parts become commercially available.


    The impact-bonding occurs within a bonding machine and uses a portable and very powerful cartridge technology recently developed by the PI, an expert in aluminum/water reactions. The cartridges are initiated in an enclosed chamber with a low voltage, which causes the disassociation of water molecules and rapid oxidization of aluminum that generates very high-pressure hydrogen in a safe and controlled manner and without the use of high voltage, explosives or flammable gun propellants. Key technological subjects of this research include the impact-energy, generated hydrogen propulsion, and the post-bond impact-energy absorption. The goal is a manufacturing process that will produce dissimilar material composite parts with superior joint strength that will survive impact-fatigue-cycles in harsh environments such as mining, demolition, excavation, construction, oil gas drilling, and many more potential industries. Other mechanical methods of joining ceramics and metals, such as brazing and adhesives, have not sustained impact fatigue cycling. The superior products are wear resistant and will benefit several industries to include the cutting tool market, electrical and thermally insulated components, ballistic armor, and others. This project aims to produce pioneering publications on impact bonding ceramics and metals and will also further enhance the knowledge of high-velocity impact bonding systems.

    This SBIR Phase II Project aims to tackle the two greatest barriers to technology adoption associated with metal additive manufacturing (AM) - cost and quantities. Current metal AM platforms use expensive core components and consumable materials in high-priced machines that produce 99.9% dense parts. The proposed project calls into question the performance requirements that most American manufacturers have for industrial grade stainless steel parts. While these manufacturers require high performance, they cannot currently afford to take advantage of AM benefits due to the high capital expenditure, maintenance, and operating costs associated with current commercial technologies. This proposal re-examines the material performance, machine cost and reliability requirements necessary for a novel metal AM system to satisfy most American manufacturers' needs. In developing a low-cost AM alternative, the goal of the proposal is to allow an estimated over 50,000 American manufacturers to capitalize on the benefits of AM and simultaneously compete in an ultra-competitive, highly globalized manufacturing industry. In addition, procurement for low to medium volume order quantities (1000 - 20,000 pieces) is incredibly challenging with respect to high cost and long lead times. The proposed invention of a low-cost machine allows for never seen scalability in metal AM, allowing for smaller manufacturers to scale by taking advantage of meaningful order quantities and compete with the resources of large conglomerates. This research has broad implications in many industries and could be fundamentally enabling for the growth and prosperity of American manufacturing.


    The proposed project re-examines the need for high technology, high cost core components in currently available commercial metallic AM machines. Through an innovative deconstruction of the inkjet print head-based, binder jetting process, a method for producing metal end-use parts has been created. The 3DEO process is based on a novel combination of two low-tech and low cost, established technologies. The creation of a robust prototype with this novel method is a highly challenging, multi-faceted project involving key advances in materials science trough the development of a novel binder system compatible with the new process as well as a fundamental evaluation and improvement of material properties of the as-built parts. In addition, completely re-designed sintering cycles and a lengthy evaluation of shrinkage characteristics will be core challenges to overcome to achieve the tight tolerances manufacturing partners require. As such, these challenges will require tight cross-disciplinary collaboration for a meaningful outcome. The goal of the proposed research is to fabricate powder metallurgy parts of adequate structural integrity to satisfy industrial end-use requirements.

    This SBIR Phase II effort will create transformative open tools to enable affordable access at scale to high quality assessments (problems & questions) for foundational subjects in secondary and post-secondary education. The explosion of online student audiences, rapid growth of Open Educational Resources (OER), and the need to support individual learners are creating an unprecedented demand for digital assessments. Assessment authoring tools today are controlled by large organizations, require advanced skills and proprietary assessment delivery platforms with restrictive collaboration features. This inequity is particularly pronounced with respect to technology-enabled assessments (TEAs) which are sophisticated, digital assessments that enable deeper learning. This effort will democratize the process of authoring and sharing TEAs through the creation of intuitive end user tools that will enable educators without advanced technical skills to author and share TEAs. This has the potential to disrupt the status quo by empowering educators to take charge of the assessment creation and distribution landscape with ground-breaking tools that enable easy authoring and distribution of sophisticated TEAs without being restricted by a proprietary assessment system. Eventually, this will empower educators at scale by triggering the evolution of a peer-to-peer marketplace around the need for assessments, and impact hundreds of thousands of learners in secondary and tertiary education settings.


    This project will follow through on two principal innovations. The first is an end-user tool that will dramatically reduce the time and expertise required to author technology-enhanced assessments. The tool will facilitate intuitive authoring of TEAs by using symbolic representation of programming constructs. The second innovation is a new standard for representation of technology-enhanced assessments that makes them usable in any delivery platform, thus making the assessments platform-neutral. This effort will also advance the frontiers of authoring beyond individual assessments to the creation of adaptive assessment pathways that will provide personalization for diverse learners. It will explore novel technologies including the representation of TEAs as intelligent and portable objects that are interoperable with disparate assessment platforms through application programming interfaces. The research studies will provide insight into how the proposed innovations can make authoring of TEAs more efficient while lowering the skills barrier for educators, and the degree to which such TEAs are effective in eliciting student reasoning and thinking processes in foundational subjects. This will be achieved through a combination of usability and validation studies in partnership with secondary and post-secondary educators drawn from different institutions.

    5G systems require exploitation of massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO)
    technology with a large number of antennas to attain significantly improved spectral
    efficiency, thereby achieving required network capacities and enhanced connectivity.
    Massive MIMO is also needed to overcome severe propagation losses in mm-wave bands,

    antennas with fixed properties, the resulting complexity and cost figures, and
    the power consumption associated with a large number of RF front ends render them

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project are numerous and include commercial, societal, environmental, and educational impacts. Commercially, an innovation of this magnitude would enable flexible design illumination, with great control over light placement, beam shape, stray light, and light pollution, all while decreasing the size and complexity of the optics and fixtures required. This will impact the amount of electricity used for lighting, helping to reduce global energy consumption, preserve our environment, and create economic and societal benefits. This project will also result in the employment several technical personnel to carry out the project's technical goals. Educational outreach will continue to impact the local community, students and researchers at nearby institutions, as well as visitors through seminars and workshops on solid-state lighting, materials research, and entrepreneurship. Furthermore, the technical results may also inform future materials research in the development of robust materials, components, and device architectures with optimal properties to advance other areas of solid-state lighting research.

    The proposed project is aimed at achieving deployment of laser-stimulated phosphor technology for illumination in the commercial marketplace. Research in the field of solid-state lighting is advancing towards the goal of ultra-efficient and smart lighting. Exploring laser-stimulated phosphor emission could lead to next generation, energy-efficient light sources, surpassing the limitations of current lighting technologies. Optical modeling and thermal simulations will be used to optimize the optics, phosphor materials, and device architectures to achieve narrow-beam angle, low-etendue, and high color-quality white light sources, while maintaining efficient operating temperature. Secondary components will be designed, including the electronics, packaging, heat sinks; compatibility tested with fixtures and manufacturing processes; and implementation into a light engine compatible in design and functionality with customer-specific applications. Regulatory, safety, and performance testing will be completed to achieve industry-specific standards, by working with regulatory bodies to test lifetime and durability in operating conditions, implementation of safety mechanisms, and photometric testing to ensure performance metrics. Lastly, planning, partnerships, execution, data collection, and reporting of field trail testing of products in real life conditions will result in a fully deployed and tested product, ready for implementation.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the enablement of advanced integration of
    thinner, more flexible and heterogeneous semiconductor devices. It will accelerate
    the adoption of next generation integrated circuit chips and bring significant
    benefit to society through the development of high performance electronics. Driven
    by portable devices in the mobile internet industry and the cost reduction requirements
    in Internet of Things (IOT), integrated circuit chips are becoming thinner and
    more flexible, whereas the working environments expose them to more extreme conditions.
    This trend creates increasing challenges and reducing reliability due to their
    higher inclination to failure. This proposed novel opto-mechanical system is able
    to identify early indications of potential problems. It can accelerate the recent
    industrial trends moving toward IOT and autonomous vehicle by significantly reducing
    development cycle time and engineering labor.  \n\nThese emerging industrial trends
    have induced many mechanical reliability issues, and are making it difficult to
    meet required quality and reliability of semiconductor devices. Many of these
    issues could be anticipated in integrated circuit design and on production lines
    with an instrument capable of measuring the sensitivity at the micron level. The
    objective of this proposed project is to develop a system for noncontact detection
    of premature failure. An imaging approach and stereo cameras are used to measure
    and track the sample. The anticipated result is to develop an instrument with
    ten-fold performance improvement over instruments currently available.\n\nThis

    Transfer (STTR) will be to develop a platform to accelerate the engineering of
    biological products, including enzymes and pathways, for production of chemicals,
    additives, and therapeutics. Enzymes are used in household materials (detergents
    and cleaners) and in chemical processes (cheese production, and bioremediation
    of waste). Pathways can produce bioplastics from sugar by engineered gut bacteria,
    or artemisinin (an antimalarial) from sugar by yeast. These biological products
    are engineered in cells. Cellular engineering, however, requires extensive scientific
    expertise, financial and material resources, and time. This project will design
    an engineering platform that eliminates production in cells. The goal is to simplify
    engineering and decrease costs 20-100 fold, and decrease time 2-5 fold. This results
    in a faster time-to-market for novel biological products and additional information
    to inform the engineering process.\n \nThis STTR Phase II project proposes to
    utilize cell-free systems to speed up enzyme and pathway (metabolic) engineering.
    Cell-free systems can catalyze reactions without cellular complexity and without
    the need to maintain cellular growth. The goal of the project is to continue to
    develop a platform that can take as input user enzyme and pathway engineering
    questions and produce as output assay data. The primary focus is on developing

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to develop low-power, low-cost and small
    form factor wireless connectivity solutions, facilitating the deployment of inexpensive and long-lived
    wireless sensors and devices for a diverse set of applications. For instance, it is infeasible to place
    conventional sensors or wireless connectivity on low-cost or disposable items due to the high cost and
    short battery life of wireless communication devices. With the successful completion of this project,
    items ranging from consumer packaged goods to medical consumables and pill bottles could be
    connected to the Internet. Brands and manufacturers could gain previously inaccessible market and
    product insights based on the way products are used, while consumers could enjoy benefits ranging
    from new services and features (such as automated product reordering) to better-designed products
    which more closely fit their needs. By enabling new use cases for wireless connectivity, this technology
    can prompt innovation across many industries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project introduces a new long-range
    backscatter-based communication technology based on Chirp Spread Spectrum, a wireless protocol
    which can be detected at extremely low signal levels. The low-power wireless system prior to this
    project is comprised of three elements: A passive backscatter-based radio, a first gateway device which
    provides an illumination signal, and a second gateway device which receives the resulting
    backscattered data and forwards data to the Internet. In this project, the passive backscatter-based
    radio will be implemented in an integrated circuit form, realizing the low power and low cost possible
    with this technology. The two gateway devices will be combined into one full-duplex radio device, to
    address the needs of the majority of deployment scenarios. Techniques to localize the backscatter
    radios within the field of the gateway device will be explored. Finally, security challenges will be
    addressed and the system will undergo extensive evaluation and testing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will research and develop new functional materials for advanced additive manufacturing. The goal of this project is to develop high performance materials for light activated 3D printers. If successful, this will enable new tools for manufacturing and research. Applications of this project would enable affordable, waste-free, and energy-efficient manufacturing with the goal of lowering barriers to innovation. Specifically, this project has the potential to improve the quality of healthcare around the world, by dramatically lowering the costs of designing and manufacturing biomedical devices.

    polySpectra has developed a new class of modular 3D printing resins, capable of manufacturing production-quality parts with tailored geometry and chemical functionality in a single step. This process is called ?functional lithography,? and it unlocks the ability to simultaneously define the form and function of advanced materials. The application of functional lithography to additive manufacturing enables production-ready parts to be directly 3D-printed, whereas existing materials can only make prototypes, mock-ups or toys. The goal of this project is to develop new advanced manufacturing processes using functional lithography, towards direct additive manufacturing of high-fidelity polymer components, devices and hardware.

    Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will focus on the design of the first completely
    automated radio frequency ablation (RFA) system for breast tissue. Of the  approximately
    200,000 breast cancer patients in the US who elect lumpectomy annually, over 20%
    must undergo re-operation due to lack of clear margins. Furthermore, many breast
    cancer patients who are treated with lumpectomy require expensive adjuvant radiation
    therapy that can last up to 7 weeks causing time away from work and family. Fortunately,
    performing intraoperative RFA of the lumpectomy cavity has been shown to decrease
    the need for re-operations and radiation therapy by sterilizing tumor margins.
    However, no RFA devices are designed for post-lumpectomy breast cavities or breast
    tissue. The RFA system being developed in this project will automate post-lumpectomy
    RFA, accurately and precisely delivering energy based on local tissue properties
    and desired ablation depth in three dimensions thus customizing treatment for
    each patient. Eventual commercialization of this system could provide early stage
    breast cancer patients new treatment options that improve quality of life, reduce
    burdens of care, and costs while providing breast cancer recurrence control.   \n\nThe
    proposed project aims to develop a system (control unit and device) for optimal
    post-lumpectomy RFA. The proposed device is designed to mechanically fit the post-lumpectomy
    cavity for near-perfect tissue contact. The control unit includes advanced algorithms
    that utilize machine learning to create a three-dimensional ablation status map
    of each margin (ablation vs in-ablated) for controlling ablation. The combined
    system allows the surgeon to customize and monitor the three-dimensional ablation
    profile and automates therapy delivery to ensure accurate, precise ablation results.
    The objectives propose gathering device requirements, identifying critical tasks
    of an automated RFA procedure, and improving the system algorithm by collecting
    training data in cadaveric and prophylactic mastectomy specimens. The intellectual
    merits proposed are: (1) an automated ablation system implemented on an embedded
    microprocessor and co?]processor FPGA capable of ablation shape estimation and
    control; (2) a system that demonstrates clinical relevance through successful
    ablation in human tissue and surgeon usability."

    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to treat chronic back and lower
    limb pain more effectively using a high-resolution stimulation technology.  Lower
    back pain affects more than 100M Americans.  While spinal cord neuro-modulation
    is successful for about 60% of patients, many people remain untreated and suffer
    from chronic pain.  Low-back pain is the most difficult to treat due as conventional
    electrode technology cannot selectively deliver energy to these fibers due to
    the bulky paddle electrode volume associated with the legacy manufacturing processes.
    \ Furthermore, to achieve maximal pain relief, neurosurgeons must wake the subjects
    during an operation to verify if the patient senses pain relief as the electrode
    is positioned.  Many subjects undergo multiple operations due to inaccurate electrode
    alignment or movement of the electrode over time due to physical activity.  The
    proposed active grid electrode technology seeks to double the size of therapeutic
    surface area, including providing therapy to low-back fibers which are not accessible
    by conventional electrodes.  The technology is expected to improve low-back pain
    relief, as well as use wireless programming to alter the therapy in the event
    of electrode movement, avoiding the need for re-operation.  \n\nThe proposed project
    seeks to double the area of the spinal cord which can receive therapeutic benefit,
    by developing an active stimulation-grid electrode grid technology.  By positioning
    a very small electronic circuit within the paddle electrode, the team is expected
    to create a 64 contact therapy array to deliver precision therapy.   To accomplish
    these goals, the project includes three critical tasks including:  (1) develop
    a medical-grade design of the implantable electronics, package, and lead array,
    (2) perform mechanical aging and stretch testing, and (3) prepare prototypes for
    subsequent ISO 14708 validation testing.  The goal of the project is to accelerate
    the medical-grade hardware development effort to enable future therapies to treat
    low-back pain.  Eventual validation after this project is completed will be performed
    in humans by selectively applying stimulation and recording if the patient feels
    therapy in the low-back area."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project on hospital service robots is improving the quality of care in hospital systems that are under increased pressure to provide high-quality patient-centric care while functioning as profitable businesses. Hospitals face a shortage of qualified nurses and high rates of nurse turnover. Nurses play a critical role in communicating care plans, educating patients, and guarding against medical errors. The amount of time they spend in direct care activities is a key determinant of patient satisfaction, better patient outcomes, fewer errors, and shorter lengths of stay. In the face of nursing shortages across the U.S., it is increasingly important to have nurses performing at the 'top of their license'. Reducing the amount of time they spend on non-nursing tasks is crucial to this goal. Automation could address these challenges and labor shortage by allowing clinical staff to focus on providing skilled care. The proposed project aims to develop technology that is general-purpose enough to transfer to other markets, such as long term care facilities and, eventually, individual consumers. Robots that perform assistive tasks in homes could increase the feasibility of independent living for many older adults.


    The proposed project will establish the technical and commercial feasibility of developing hospital service robots that act as assistants on acute care units, enabling nurses to spend more time at the bedside with patients. This project will make technical advances along three dimensions: the ability of the proposed robot to autonomously navigate within nursing units and across the hospital (navigation capabilities); to easily adapt its manipulation skills to specific tasks and to physical characteristics of a particular hospital/unit (adaptive learning of manipulation skills); and to work alongside humans in a socially acceptable manner, including appropriate navigation in crowded hallways, speech, and eye gaze behaviors that communicate the robot's intentions (socially intelligent interoperability). The team intends to collaborate closely with a single partner hospital to iteratively improve the reliability and robustness of the artificial intelligence software suite developed with NSF funding and to deploy production-quality versions of the three core competencies. The final 6 months will involve a long-term deployment, with the robot autonomously working on an acute care unit of the partner hospital. The impact of the robot on unit staff and workflows will be documented, with the ultimate goal of developing a service robot that hospital staff view as a competent member of the care team.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to enable and support the future development, approval, and clinical use of new therapeutics the cure HIV-1 infection.  HIV-1 infection can be controlled by available antiretroviral therapy, but cannot be cured due to the persistence of the virus in a quiescent, or latent state.  This latent HIV-1 is the barrier to curing infection.  While latent HIV-1 can be found in all infected individuals, it is present in very low frequencies.  To cure HIV-1 infection, new therapeutics that eliminate latent HIV-1 must be developed.  This development is hindered by current lack of a sensitive, accurate, and scalable test to measure latent HIV-1 in infected individuals.

    The proposed project seeks to develop and optimize a sensitive, accurate, and scalable test to measure latent HIV-1 in the blood of infected individuals.  Current tests used in research laboratories to measure latent HIV-1 are either non-specific or require large volumes of blood and many days to complete.  This project is focused on developing a new molecular test that specifically measures latent HIV-1 from a minimal volume of blood in hours.  Specifically, the project is focused on defining initial test performance and developing critical assay controls needed for robust performance of this new molecular test for latent HIV-1.  Successful completion of this project will yield a latent HIV-1 test prototype that can be advanced to market to support research and early-stage clinical trials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of a user-friendly asthma management solution. The asthma management tool consists of a portable medical device and mobile app combination that measures lung function with the consistency and accuracy of a trained lab technician, displaying current asthma status, and providing health insights to act upon. During the 2-year duration of this proposal, the applicant will further develop a machine-learning algorithm that obtains the same level of consistency and accuracy as if a trained lab technician were coaching and correcting the asthmatic patient on proper usage. Steps will be taken to establish the efficacy of such technology through verification of classification by pulmonologists. In order to engage users to continue using the product over several months, gamification elements will be implemented into the mobile app. By expanding on the machine-model through a longitudinal study, earlier detection of asthma exacerbations may be identified. Early detection leads to improved self-management as measured by the reduction of severe asthma attacks, the use of systemic corticosteroids, hospitalizations, emergency department or urgent care visits related to asthma.

    The proposed project aims to develop an asthma management tool that provides parents a simple way to reliably monitor their child's lung health, eliminating the guesswork associated with relying on symptoms alone. The rate of asthma continues to rise, with an increasing amount of healthcare utilization among asthmatic individuals. Effective technologies for proper management remain trapped within the hospital due to high costs and requirement of a skilled lab technician for proper measurement collection. This proposal aims to develop an algorithm alongside UCSF pediatric pulmonologists to gain consistent and accurate spirometry measurements, so that only proper measurements are acted upon. Our machine-learning algorithm will determine the cause of failure and prompt the user on corrective action to achieve a good quality measurement on a subsequent effort. By the end of this proposal period, the applicant will have a mobile app algorithm that is able to achieve the consistency of a trained lab technician, provide effective corrective feedback, engage users over the span of months for consistent lung monitoring, and potentially predict the onset of an asthma attack.

    This SBIR Phase II project should increase the adoption of pedagogically validated educational games that facilitate retention and effective use of business concepts taught and relevant to managing organizations. Start-ups, for-profit and nonprofit companies all need managers who can make effective decisions in the face of complexity and uncertainty. It is of the utmost importance to society, therefore, that the next generation of business leaders is equipped with relevant frameworks and tools that supplement traditional teaching methods and enable effective use of knowledge on the job. Hence, this project has the potential to empower the U.S. workforce to be more productive and innovative, which will improve existing business outcomes and thus drive U.S. job and economic growth. Improved business operations will also lead to more profitable business in general and potentially larger tax revenues for the U.S. government. Eventually opening the GDL to third-party authors in the $18.6 billion global game-based learning market will accelerate game innovation and usage in other business and engineering disciplines at a lower cost, which will both enhance the effectiveness of the STEM workforce and encourage more economic activity in the game development market.

    This project is based on three innovations that differentiate this solution from others: (1) a scientific Game Research and Development (GR&D) process designs games containing pedagogical learning objectives; (2) a Game Design Language (GDL) accelerates implementation of game concepts as automatically validated, domain specific language while eliminating runtime errors; and (3) an innovative web Game Distribution Platform (GDP) minimizes the effort to setup and manage games in the classroom. Typical educational game development in languages such as JavaScript is time-consuming, involves professional software engineers and requires debugging of runtime errors, while usage of game technology in the class is disruptive to the flow of instruction. Such challenges are therefore prohibitive for non-professional programmers and game administrators such as professors. To mitigate the problem of runtime errors, this project employs methods of video game development, which typically use domain-specific languages based on non-Turing-complete models of computation to solve these issues. Games created with GDL will enable rapid new game development and have a guaranteed level of technical quality, allowing professors to focus on pedagogical relevance during instruction. The main technical hurdle is to tailor these methods to result in GDL capable of expressing the Operations Management (OM) games conceived during the scientific GR&D process and playable via the GDP that enables seamless class integration.

    This SBIR Phase II project continues previous development of an invention disclosure tool that allows users to draft a United States Patent and Trademark Office compliant patent applications by using an intuitive interface and game-based educational tools to draft patent applications. Inventors and small companies having no background in patent law and patent-application drafting strategies struggle with properly describing their inventions.  Overcoming this lack of understanding on the part of the inventor requires a great deal of one-on-one educational training with a patent professional in order to draft a quality patent application. However, engaging a patent professional is costly and time consuming. This project expands the capacity of the invention disclosure software by allowing users to configure and customize the software for specific types of inventions and arts.

    Specifically, this project proposes a new customization tool for integration with the existing invention disclosure tool to allow for widespread adoption into varied technology arts. The customization tool comprises software modules that allow end users to identify and create narrative goals, design software interfaces by configuring display rules, design text output state configurations based on logical operators, design natural language output, design the natural language generated output that is desired for that product type and configure template text, token input, and grammar associations, and determine the position of natural language output into an overall document structure. This customization tool will allow for rapid, scalable distribution of the product to be driven by end users rather than through a traditional software development process, e.g., 1) researching, 2) market testing, and 3) designing and implementing each new version of a product for different technology arts.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies in the development of a novel cost-effective 3D printing process to manufacture footwear. Currently most footwear is mass manufactured, typically overseas, using fixed molds that do not meet the specific needs of an individual. 3D printing of footwear offers the promise of providing individual customization tailored not just to fit, style, and colors, but also to individual biomechanics and/or medical needs. However, a number of technical challenges exist to make 3D printing of footwear sufficiently cost-effective that it can be provided beyond just a select few individuals. This project develops a novel and cost-effective 3D printing process to manufacture the critical components of footwear, using readily available and recyclable thermoplastic pellets. This novel 3D printing process will enable the manufacture of new, innovative footwear designs that cannot be made with any other manufacturing process. Additionally, it will make mass customization of footwear a reality, providing access to healthy customizable footwear for many individuals. Unlike traditional manufacturing processes currently being done overseas, this novel manufacturing technology is very amenable to implementing in the United States on a local level. Thus, this project will not only help move footwear manufacturing back to the United States, generating income for tax revenue, it will create entirely new clean, safe jobs in manufacturing.


    This project, led by a woman physician-scientist with a unique combination of expertise in both biomechanics and manufacturing, develops a novel and cost-effective 3D printing technology to print a proprietary mix of elastomeric material into a novel sole design that was developed on the basis of over twenty years of biomechanics research. The primary innovation that is being developed in this project is a specialized plasticizing screw-based extruder mounted on a 3D printer, specifically designed to make footwear, that uniquely and reliably extrudes a recyclable, thermo-elastomeric material that is most suitable for footwear, from its most cost-effective raw form: pellets. This project also develops a novel healthy and customizable sole design, based on the principal investigator's biomechanical research, which can only be made with this manufacturing technology innovation. Finally, this project develops a biomechanically research-based algorithm for customizing footwear made with this technology based on an individual's specific biomechanical profile and/or specific medical need. This project will allow for a novel, cost-effective manufacturing process where a bank of 3D printers operate simultaneously, each producing their own made-to-order pair of footwear and/or footwear components customized not only to fit but to an individual's specific biomechanical profile and/or medical need.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to demonstrate the feasibility of Battery Resourcers recycling process on a scale that has commercial significance. This will further allow Battery Resourcers to scale its process such that it can be a player in the lithium ion battery recycling market place. Battery Resourcers' ultimate goal is into increase recycling rates of spent Li-ion batteries by providing an economically viable domestic recycling option.  Additionally, Battery Resourcers process produces low cost cathode materials for the battery industry which may ultimately further enable green technologies like solar, wind and electric vehicles.

    This SBIR Phase 1 award proposes to scale the Battery Resourcers recycling process from 50kg to 0.5 tons of spent Li-ion batteries. The proposed research focuses on process speed, safety and the quality of the recovered materials. Rate limiting steps in Battery Resourcers recycling process will be studied with an effort to improve process speed. Specifically, Battery Resourcers will look at new filtering methods for the solutions generated in its process. A method to safety shred Li-ion batteries is examined by controlling the atmosphere and removing the batteries' stored energy. Finally, the production of quality cathode materials from spent Li-ion batteries is scaled from 50kg to 0.5 tons.  Battery Resourcers' goal is to produce commercial quality cathode powder on a scale that matters to industry.

    research into the US math crisis and the complexity of the problem. As a nation,
    we must invest resources directly into the breaking point: the mid school math
    cliff. The US shows the greatest decline worldwide from 4th to 10th grade on International
    tests in math. This project is designed to address all 146 Common Core State Standards
    (and all other state math standards) from 5th to 8th grade, providing a virtual
    reality context for each standard, embedded in an engaging, interactive 3-Act
    math story problem. The theoretical foundation of the project stems from Productive
    Failure, the concept that students perform better when they encounter productive
    failure prior to direct instruction in contrast to the reverse, where instruction
    is given first. Additionally, each simulator directly links student input to functional
    output to show how the math works, specifically allowing students to persist in
    exploring solutions. This project supports the NSF mission to support education
    for all fields fundamental to science and engineering, and holds the potential
    to positively impact a critical problem in U.S. education through broad commercial
    acceptance in schools throughout the US. \n\nThis project is designed to provide
    simulations in a virtual reality context for all standards from 5th to 8th grade,
    using a core software platform for delivery that can be ubiquitously used in classrooms
    throughout the United States. This high-risk technical innovation uniquely embeds
    math content in such a way that input leads to functional output such that students
    can see how the math actually works. Students watch the outcomes of their solutions,
    both the successes and the failures so they can try again. Math problems have
    context and meaning. Students experience the direct results of their mathematical
    abilities, while teachers have the ability to deploy specific problems and receive
    real-time metrics to further respond and support student comprehension. Underlying
    the advanced classroom technology is the pedagogical framework based on Productive
    Failure and the intentional withholding of instruction and information prior to
    direct experience with grappling with a difficult problem with trial and error
    repetition. The goal of the research is to illustrate that math simulations show
    the highest achievement in comparison to other methodologies and that Productive
    Failure is a viable tenant of learning that can be applied to all fields supporting
    higher math applications and scientific discovery."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be in development of Ultrasonic Nanocoining - a new platform technology that is used to generate plastic films or glass panels that are anti-reflective, self-cleaning, or colored through structure. Such nano-structured surfaces can provide benefits for a wide array of commercial applications, ranging from consumer electronics to automotive and aerospace. These surfaces can save energy by preventing internal reflections in OLED displays and cover-glass reflections on the surface of solar panels. What?s more, these surfaces enable better use of available space by adding functionality to surfaces without adding any appreciable volume. Nanocoining is a low-temperature, chemical-free process that does not rely on chemical etching or nano-particles, which have recently come under scrutiny from the EPA because of unknown health and environment effects. The science contained within the project spans several disciplines, and Nanocoining would ultimately contribute to low-cost, scalable manufacturing for a wide array of industries.


    Ultrasonic Nanocoining enables low-cost, high volume reproduction of surface textures comprised of nano-structures that are smaller than the wavelength of visible light. This is done by creating a cylindrical mold with a nano-structured surface, then imprinting that mold into plastics using roll-to-roll processing. The objectives of the current project are to use Nanocoining to indent billions of sub-wavelength features into both flat and cylindrical Nickel-plated molds in a continuous pattern, then use these molds to replicate the structure into a variety of polymer materials using roll-to-roll processing. The research will study each step of the mold fabrication process, including focused ion beam machining of the diamond die, controlling a dual-mode ultrasonic resonant actuator and registering millions of indents side-by-side without leaving a significant seam between them. Replicated film surfaces will be tested for optical and wetting properties, and the final result will be functionalized transparent film samples that prove commercial potential. In the future the process may be used to create meter-scale nano-structured metal molds for production-scale imprinting.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to revolutionize the efficiency of electric motors in the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) market. The innovation technology area is a new class of electric motor and control hardware and software that is based on switched reluctance technology, exhibiting very high efficiencies of 90%+ across a broad range of speeds. This innovation will enhance scientific understanding by showing how this new class of electric motors can be optimized to minimize noise and vibration, while allowing variable speed control and Internet connectivity. The potential societal impacts of such a technology are significant: more than half the new motors purchased each year in the United States are 1-5 horsepower motors (1.024M of 1.792M), and they collectively account for nearly 25% of the United States electricity consumption. As such, if commercialized this technology could save retail and commercial organizations millions of dollars a year in electricity savings due to efficiency improvements. The benefits for an adoption rate of just 5% of available applications are $500M / year in electricity savings and 1M tons / year of carbon savings.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project aims to research a new type of electric motor with a high rotor pole switched reluctance (HRSRM) design. This HRSRM motor has a simplified physical construction with no permanent magnets but complex electronics that manage the torque and speed in the motor through carefully timed generation of magnetic fields. This class of motors have proven extremely difficult to research because of highly nonlinear response characteristics, and sensitivity to very small changes in timing, electromagnetics, and physical setup. This project will research methods for adapting dynamic control algorithms to increase the speed and sensitivity of the power electronics to manage these characteristics. Research will also examine physical elements of the design and build a generalized simulation model combining both finite element analysis as well as structural modeling, constrained mode analysis and vibration models to reduce and optimize noise, vibration and harshness measures. Finally this project will optimize the ~600 key parameters associated with an HRSRM motor, allowing the rapid design and prototyping of new motor designs in minutes rather than months.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel, intraoperative imaging
    technology to address the problem of inadvertent cuts to vasculature during minimally
    invasive surgeries. More than 17% of patients who undergo these types of in-patient
    surgeries suffer from an intraoperative bleeding event. When a vessel is injured,
    there is a higher probability of hospital borne infection due to the loss of blood,
    and the added cost of care per patient increases by thousands of dollars due to
    corrective action and extended length of stay for the patient. The risk of vascular
    injury is compounded by risk factors, such as obesity, which limit the surgeon's
    ability to visualize and navigate vasculature. Therefore, there is a critical
    need to identify and assess hidden vasculature in real time. The proposed technology
    helps identify blood vessel before a cut is made. Importantly, this system will
    be designed for seamless integration into a suite of surgical instruments for
    multiple applications. Long term, the company will provide surgeons with the preeminent
    imaging platform to view, assess, and characterize a range of vessels (i.e. arteries/veins,
    ureters and bile ducts) in real-time for improved surgical guidance and outcomes.
    \n\nThe proposed project will develop a novel blood vessel detection and visualization
    platform using low-cost optical imaging sensors and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
    The proposed technology will provide visual and quantitative information about
    vessel presence and size in real-time that can supplement a surgeon's technique.
    This system will be simple, cost-effective, easy to employ, and highly accurate.
    Traditionally, the avoidance of blood vessels during minimally invasive surgery
    is accomplished by visualization or costly intraoperative imaging. The proposed
    technology will use pulsatile light absorption characteristics of blood vessels
    to provide quantitative information about vessel presence and size in real-time,
    supplementing a surgeon's technique. This project will also add significant value
    to the body of research conducted in the areas of signal processing and image
    analysis. In addition, the proposed technology will remove the risk of data loss
    due to artifacts in general and motion artifacts in particular. The proposed technology
    will be validated ex vivo and in vivo using a porcine animal model."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project has the objective of demonstrating that discrete, belt mounted internet-connected wearable devices used by industrial workers can detect high risk lifting activities, promote safe lifting practices and behavior change, and predict the risk of musculoskeletal injuries due to unsafe lifting. Each year over 600,000 workers suffer a musculoskeletal injury due to lifting related activities, which cost US companies over $15bn annually. Worker injuries affect employee morale, absenteeism, productivity loss and employee turnover, all of which are challenges to the efficient running of a company and are a unnecessary cause of human suffering. By developing a wearable device that can detect high risk lifting activity and provide immediate feedback to workers, safer lifting practices can be promoted and a reduction in the number of unsafe lifts registered, leading to a reduction in injuries.

    The project includes three main technical objectives: i) the development of machine learning algorithms to detect lifting events from sensor data, and to measure risk related metrics associated to those lifting events. When a lift is considered high risk, real-time feedback will be provided to the worker; ii) the deployment of the device in an industrial setting at several customer sites for 12 months, with the number of high risk lifts performed by workers quantified over time to measure the ability of the system to drive behavior change in the workforce; and ii) the development of a model that can predict the likelihood of musculoskeletal injures based on the risk metrics measured. It is expected that the outcomes of the project demonstrate a significant reduction in the risk of suffering musculoskeletal injuries, paving the way for a clear return on investment value proposition for the industrial companies and their insurance carriers who are potential customers.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the effort to bring our biomimetic rotor
    design to the marine hydrokinetic (MHK) market. MHK energy is a socially and environmentally
    friendly alternative to hydroelectric power, which harnesses energy from rivers,
    tides, ocean currents and manmade waterways without the use of a dam. This market
    is potentially large but still nascent due to high technology costs, concerns
    over turbine survivability, fish friendliness, and difficulty in permitting deployments.
    Our rotor's small, flexible configuration is a unique approach that addresses
    many MHK challenges with the mission of reaching the largest set of individuals
    underserved by current energy technologies. Our rotor seeks to displace diesel
    generation and complement intermittent renewable energy sources by providing an
    affordable, baseload clean energy solution for any individual or community; with
    the objective of scaling up to larger deployments by leveraging the scalable rotor
    design. This R&D Project will expand the body of knowledge for the rapidly emerging
    field of biomimicry by developing a flexible micro-hydro solution that enables
    energy generation from flowing water by allowing fluids to move over the surfaces
    of the rotor in their naturally preferred way. \n\n\n\nThis project will transform
    our promising proprietary rotor design into an optimized MHK turbine to be incorporated
    as the key component of a flexible micro-hydro system that addresses many of the
    challenges faced by the MHK market. The rotor is based on biomimicry and was designed
    using streamlines found in moving bodies of water with a deep profile to maximize
    the power transfer from low speed flows. The logarithmic design with receding
    edges results in a turbine that avoids damaging impacts with debris and marine
    life. The design is stable in variable flow conditions, which allows for a flexible
    power takeoff configuration with both the generator and power electronics housed
    above the water for improved affordability. During the project, computational
    fluid dynamic modeling will be used to simulate design changes and drive performance
    improvements. The most promising designs will be prototyped and integrated with
    multiple generator and tether combinations to determine the most efficient flexible
    power takeoff system. Conversion to power output for 12V battery charging will
    also be tested and optimized resulting in a complete power conversion chain. The
    performance of the rotor and system will be characterized by full scale testing
    locally and with The University of Washington."

    surgical systems and more. Embedding these cameras in endoscope systems, and even
    the surgical tools themselves, permits new treatments across a broad range of
    medical specialties that otherwise are not possible. Switching to the minimally

    these ultra-compact cameras. A broader impact will ultimately come from utilizing
    submicron pixels in unique ways in high density arrays. The sensor?s small size
    and fast response times offer unique opportunities for spatial and temporal oversampling.
    The resulting large numbers of pixels can be employed in a compact multi-aperture
    arrangement to deliver significantly enhanced color mapping over traditional semiconductor
    imaging arrays, multispectral imaging, 3-dimensional image reconstruction, motion
    free auto-focusing, or some combination of the above, providing unique applications
    in medical imaging, defense, robotics, and consumer electronics.  \n\nThe miniaturization
    of camera systems calls for the continuous shrinking of pixel sizes. At a certain
    point, however, the maximum photo-electrons a pixel can hold becomes limited,
    yielding low signal-to-noise ratios and poor dynamic range. This project develops
    a novel optical sensor that maintains sensitivity down to hundreds of nanometers.
    As the size of this sensor decreases, the maximum measurable light intensity can
    remain constant and the signal-to-noise increases, bringing significant improvements
    to images? dynamic range and color/feature rendition. This result stands in stark
    contrast to the behavior of conventional pixels where maximum intensity threshold
    scales down with pixel size and noise increases with decreasing pixel size. Reducing
    these image sensors to practice requires transitioning from gallium arsenide based
    devices to silicon.  The work focuses on 1) finalizing design parameters, fabrication,
    and characterization of the electrical properties and optical response of the
    system and 2) fabrication and characterization of a linear photodetector array
    for the creation of both linear images and 2-D images assembled from linear images
    to characterize the noise, contrast and other image quality parameters of the

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in its ability to improve healthcare in fundamental ways, such as (1) low volume draws that will enable diagnostics in low-resource settings like drug stores, at home, or in developing countries, (2) higher quality small-volume samples to make Point-of-Care (POC) diagnostics more competitive with lab tests, enabling faster results in critical care/outpatient environments, and (3) low draw volumes, coupled with small volume diagnostic tests, that will enable improved care for patients at risk for hospital-acquired anemia, including neonates and patients with bone marrow damage caused by cancers or suppressed bone marrow due to cancer drugs. Our technology will enable medical testing from a small amount of blood, which could significantly impact global neonatal and pediatric healthcare, particularly in developing countries, and expand the market for blood containers.


    This project aims to design a microliter-scale blood container that offers the same analytic stability and consistency as blood samples obtained by larger volume tubes.  Critical to specimen stability is the ability to rapidly and uniformly distribute an anticoagulant in a blood specimen.  In larger containers, mixing is achieved by shaking a collection tube, creating turbulent flow wherein eddies and vortices mix the blood with the stabilizing reagent.  In low volume containers, fluid flow is laminar and shaking does not produce mixing.  Typical low volume containers rely on diffusion driven mixing.  This process is slow, and frequently results in the formation of micro-clots prior to complete specimen stabilization.  We will use our proprietary actuated, surface-attached posts (ASAP) to rapidly and thoroughly distribute anticoagulant in blood, increasing the accuracy and the reproducibility of results obtained from small volume draws.  This project will begin with an assessment of the biocompatibility of materials and specimen processing procedures.  We will test a number of ASAP configurations in order to minimize the time required for specimen stabilization.  The project will culminate with the production of a fully functional prototype that will be validated via comparison against blood stabilized in a larger volume specimen tube.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in providing manufactured concrete blocks that can be used to build arches, including roofs.  This feature has never been done with manufactured concrete block, and holds the potential to greatly expand the uses, benefits and capabilities of concrete block to an entirely new market segment.  The structures expected to be made possible with this novel masonry system include inexpensive, high-performance, energy efficient buildings with increased fire safety ratings, resistance to termites, increased safety for tornadoes, hurricanes, tsunamis and other sever weather events, and greatly increased building life cycle time. This technology could have a large positive economic impact on masonry construction and on the concrete block manufacturing industry in particular, both across the US and around the globe.  This work is expected to provide a greater understanding of the anisotropic strength of manufactured concrete block, and how this anisotropic strength is to be maximized within a given structure; this scientific understanding is expected to benefit the catenary thrust-line analysis of masonry arches.  This technology is expected to make superior construction available to homeowners, businesses, government buildings and public works (including bridges) at greatly reduced cost.


    This project will create a design for a building which will utilize as many of the common features made available by this masonry system which the average user (homeowner, building owner, business, government agency, etc.) is expected to want to use.  This building will be designed as a planetarium for Alfred University's Stull Observatory, and will include a twenty-four foot diameter planetarium room, as a domed hemisphere, made as a third frequency truncated icosahedron.  This building will also include a separate meeting room and a separate office.  This building will include Gothic windows, arched roofs, and flying buttresses which will create an outdoor porch which rings the outside of this building.  This building will be designed with a Professional Engineer and a Registered Design Professional (architect) to show all the equations, stress analyses, free body diagrams, etc., which were used to arrive at the final design.  Once completed, this building will serve as a test or sample building used to obtain an Evaluation Report by the International Code Council - Evaluation Services (ICC-ES).  A positive Evaluation Report from ICC-ES will allow this technology to be sold globally in accordance with the International Building Code (IBC).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the quality of care for anterior ocular wounds. To accomplish this, the project is focused on the development of a novel, hand-held, point-of-care device that can be used to evaluate the ocular surface in post-trauma or post-surgical patients. The device should be able to provide an accurate, objective measurement of a tear film biomarker that can be used by medical professionals to identify dangerous fluid leaks in the front of the eye which can save vision. Currently, this evaluation is only performed by trained eye doctors and requires positioning the patient at an expensive, immobile machine called a slit lamp to evaluate their eye. This cannot be done on patients who are unconscious or uncooperative and availability of this machine is limited. The lack of adequate tools for evaluation results in limited access to care, costly hospital transfers and missed diagnosis of wound leaks which can cause severe ocular infections and permanent vision loss. Successful commercialization of this product is expected to improve the accuracy of ocular examinations in 3.8 million Americans annually and may introduce a new frontier of tear film testing.


    The proposed project is focused on developing the device for direct use for patient care. The technological aim of the research is on the creation of a sophisticated biosensor that can accurately and noninvasively evaluate the tear film concentration of a specific biomarker. This work is expected to include the development of the electrical circuitry, the chemical composition and the channels for connection to the base unit. The plan is to also design the model for the handheld device. In order to make the device safe for patient use, the device can then be tested for its shelf-life stability and develop the proper sterilization. The next steps of testing can include clinical patients to evaluate the ability of the device to record the findings from the tear film. This information can then be used to refine the exact testing parameters for the device. The anticipated result of this research is a final prototype of the device that can be used for regulatory approval and clinical trials. The goal of the project is to transform the current standard of care for eye professionals and enable physicians to have an objective measure that can warn them about possible wound leaks and potentially save vision.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in the improvement of atmospheric state observations from various platforms. This compact, integrated and ?plug and play? receiver design will make the existing observations more available, more economical, and will also enable previously unattainable observations of water vapor distributions within the atmosphere. This environmental sensor?s small size and low power requirements enables its deployment on various airborne, spaceborne or ground-based platforms, such as unmanned aerial aircraft, nanosatellites, ocean buoys, and remotely located ground-based instruments. One promising commercial application is private weather observing satellite constellations. It has been estimated that around 400 remote sensing nano/microsatellites will be launched worldwide between the years of 2016-2018. Water vapor and cloud observations are among the most important observations promising further understanding of weather events and to better synoptic or mesoscale forecasts. Improved atmospheric observations are directly related to increasingly accurate and useful weather forecasts. The benefits are expected to extend widely across the economy. Meteorologists point to more accurate and rapidly refreshed atmospheric observations as one of the necessities for the continuous improvements in weather forecasting, understanding of the atmospheric physics and climate.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will complete the design and build a fully functional prototype of a very compact, direct detection radiometer receiver, operating in the vicinity of the 183 GHz water vapor absorption line. All the receiver components will be designed and evaluated, including a noise source, detectors, filters, Monolithic Microwave Integrated circuits and others, first as individual parts and then within the assembly. A novel receiver architecture and integration of all components into one assembly allow for a drastic reduction in the receiver size and reduction of its power consumption, while improving its observational capabilities and stability. There are several aspects of the proposed effort that are unique and would provide profound advances in ultra-compact microwave radiometry. The receiver is expected to consume less than 0.5 Watt of power and weigh around 100 grams, with a continuous two-point calibration capability at its input.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is to overcome limitations that prevent effective treatment of wound infections. There is a large potential market for this product as the U.S. spends over $50 billion per year on wound care and current wound care products have a high risk of rejection, scarring, and antibiotic resistance. The proposed novel wound care product will reduce the costs to treat infected wounds and limit the number of medical procedures required to restore tissue function. The product consists of a patented human extracellular matrix (hECM) coupled to a novel antimicrobial peptide (AMP). The main innovation of the proposed product, compared to current treatments, is that it is designed to be toxic to infective bacteria and other pathogens, without harming human tissue. The hECM has regenerative and anti-inflammatory activity to enhance wound healing and improve treatment outcomes. In addition to creating a transformative product in a global market, achievement of AMP extracellular matrix tethering will lead to a broader understanding of AMP activity and unlock their commercial utility. The product can be used as a temporary wound dressing, a tissue restoring implant, or an implant coating.


    The proposed project will utilize a patented recombinant protein with an antimicrobial peptide, combined with a human extracellular matrix (hECM) material. The patented antimicrobial protein (AMP) is designed to bind collagen in the hECM. The combination of hECM and AMP will result in an antimicrobial regenerative matrix that will reduce the incidence of infection and improve wound healing. The objectives of the project are to scale-up hECM and AMP manufacturing processes, establish methods for assessing product characteristics and performance for manufacturing quality assurance and release criteria, and evaluate the shelf-life and in vivo performance of the scaled-up manufactured AMP-hECM product in a clinically relevant infectious wound healing model.  The AMP-hECM will be evaluated using biochemical, antimicrobial, mechanical and cell growth performance assays.  Scale-up of the bioengineered AMP and hECM will be achieved by optimizing the in vitro manufacturing bioreactor growth parameters and processing methods to improve overall product yield.  The anticipated outcome of the project is to have defined the large-scale manufacturing protocols and release criteria for the AMP-hECM product. This milestone will enable the execution of validation production runs, and advance the regulatory and commercialization pathways for the product.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will address a pressing need for more environmentally responsible coating alternatives in the anti-corrosion market through the commercialization of a novel aluminum-based coating.   If successfully commercialized, the aluminum electroplating process will displace multiple existing anti-corrosion coatings, which are based on toxic metals.  The current market for these coatings is valued at $10 billion annually.  The replacement of the toxic metals with aluminum will eliminate their release into the environment.  The process is also expected to be less expensive than the incumbent technologies.  The reduction in cost arises from decreases in plating solution, waste treatment, and metal costs.  By decreasing the cost of corrosion-resistant coatings, it may also be possible to reduce the flow of plating jobs to less environmentally responsible areas overseas.  For the aerospace industry, which is the initial target market, the availability of the process will mean safer conditions for workers, less environmental impact, and lower costs. In the process of addressing these needs in the coatings market, the research will elucidate a variety of interesting phenomena associated with electroplating of highly active metal species.

    The intellectual merit of this project is associated with its exploration of aqueous electroplating of highly active metals in the presence of atmospheric moisture and oxygen.  Typically, electroplating of aluminum has taken place from organic solvents such as toluene at elevated temperatures under an inert purge.  The expense and difficulty in scaling this technology has prevented its adoption for many applications, which might make good use of aluminum coatings.  The goal of the project will be to overcome the technical challenges in scaling-up an aqueous aluminum electroplating process for producing aluminum coatings.  Challenges to be addressed include mass transfer, current distribution, and coating quality control in industrial-scale plating baths.  To address these challenges, the project team will work closely with partners in the electroplating industry, ultimately demonstrating the technology at scale in a working commercial plating shop.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a hormone-free treatment alternative for women suffering from vaginal atrophy. Vaginal atrophy is a condition in which the vaginal tissue is thin, dry, and inelastic. Women with vaginal atrophy experience day-to-day vaginal dryness and pain with intercourse. This SBIR project catalyzes the development of a technology platform that will enable a novel home-use, hormone-free medical device to treat vaginal atrophy. This project represents a medical device treatment for vaginal atrophy developed specifically for women wishing to avoid hormone-based therapies. Currently available treatment options fall in two categories: over-the-counter products and hormone-replacement therapies. Over-the-counter products, like lubricants, are available at drugstores, but these products are often limited in their efficacy relative to the severity of symptoms many women experience. Hormone-replacement therapies on the other hand, such as estrogen creams, can be effective for women; however they are contraindicated for large market segments of women (e.g. breast cancer survivors and women with cardiovascular risk factors). Therefore, this SBIR project is critical to the development of a safe treatment alternative for women and represents a chance to significantly improve their quality of life.

    The proposed project supports the technical work required to develop this medical device treatment and addresses a major unmet need for breast cancer survivors and post-menopausal women. The work supported by this SBIR grant will complete necessary device improvements and prepare the technology platform for commercialization. The main objectives of this project are to 1) optimize the device for safety and usability, 2) execute specific design enhancements to ensure cost-effective manufacturability, and 3) complete all necessary quality system testing to meet FDA (Food and Drug Administration) requirements. To achieve the first objective, the company will complete all prescribed activities under the company's quality management system. User interviews will also be completed with device prototypes to explore features that enable and encourage appropriate device use. This work will be completed in cooperation between the company's engineering team and an outside industrial design firm. The second objective will require design for manufacturing activities, which will also be completed in a partnership with an outside firm. The third objective will be executed again by following the company's quality management system policies, processes, and procedures. All of these activities, once complete, will ensure the company's device is ready for commercialization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the result of introducing a new generation of low-power wireless sensors for detecting Acoustic Emission events and detecting fatigue damage in structures. According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the US transportation infrastructure has 605,102 operational bridges, of which 66,561 are structurally deficient. In particular, the fatigue damage monitoring technology of the project will initially target the more than 18,000 US highway bridges that are categorized as ?fracture critical? by the Federal Highway Administration. The technique?s ultra-low energy consumption will enable its use in low-power wireless sensors and make it an ideal response to this challenging problem. The anticipated benefits and commercial applications of this project are (1) a low-cost, easy-to-use mechanism for effective monitoring, allowing for early detection and timely repair of fracture and fatigue damage in infrastructure systems such as highway bridges; (2) improved public safety, with reduced maintenance costs and extension of the service life of critical and high-valued infrastructure systems; and (3) additional commercial applications in monitoring the structural health and integrity of other structures, including aircraft, oil and gas pipelines, machinery, cargo cranes, ships, etc.

    Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses distributed structural health monitoring (SHM) of infrastructure systems, particularly highway bridges. Because the creation of fatigue cracks in a structure is accompanied by the propagation of acoustic emission (AE) waves, wireless AE sensors can be used to detect such cracks. However, a challenge of AE detection sensors is high energy consumption, significantly more than the energy available in a battery-operated wireless device. As a result, conventional AE detection methods cannot be used with low-power wireless sensors. This project uses a novel and ultra-low power technique for long term monitoring of strain.  Then, AE monitoring is activated only if history of tensile strain in the structure under monitoring suggests likelihood of fatigue damage. In addition, using history and pattern of AE events, the method estimates the severity of fatigue damage in a material. Moreover, the method uses a variety of techniques to eliminate the effects of mechanical noise on AE measurements and achieve a high reliability in fatigue damage assessment. After development, the method is planned to be evaluated on highway bridges, airframes, and pipelines.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research, Phase II project is to help make therapy more consistent with patient preferences, beliefs, and values to maximize engagement in therapy and improve patient outcomes. Therapy for mental health problems is highly effective, yet many patients drop out before getting the full benefit because they are not satisfied or engaged in the therapy. The proposed project involves collecting data on all of patients actions in the online treatment system along with their ratings of each activity and their symptom improvement over time. The research and development team will use this data to create a machine learning system that will make suggestions for best next steps in therapy based on what thousands of other users experienced. This is the intelligent counseling system. It will work very similarly to movie streaming services or online book sellers who recommend movies or books to you based on your past preferences and the preferences of thousands of other users.

    The proposed project will develop a feedback and recommendation system based on advanced analytics and machine learning techniques to provide personalized treatments to customize and individualize online mental health treatment, the Intelligent Counseling System (ICS). This personalized system will contain a number of alternative treatment items from several theoretical perspectives, using a variety of patient interactive activities, varying in format, length, pace, and other characteristics. In such a setting, a recommendation system can predict the users' preferences and recommend the subsequent treatment component. In addition, to achieve maximum adherence and to decrease the attrition rate, the platform will enable personalized motivational interventions and supportive messaging. The delivery times and the content of supportive messaging will adapt and vary depending on the projected treatment progress. Our machine learning based system will be trained incrementally as more data becomes available over time, thus it will benefit from improved accuracy over time. We will extract local, semi-local, and global temporal features at multiple temporal resolutions and will use feature selection techniques to identify which factors contribute to the success of treatments for patients, and to predict if a user is improving or is deteriorating. This will result in adaptive motivational messages and recommendation for tailoring treatment in term of important identified treatment features.

    detect early onset Alzheimer's and brain tumors, and Choline PET/CT for the diagnosis
    and staging of prostate cancer. Carbon-11 is an important radiotracer/radiopharmaceutical
    that offers unique advantages due to its ability to be easily incorporated into
    many molecules without impacting biological activity.  Carbon-11 is currently
    produced by using specialized targets on high-energy commercial cyclotrons.  These
    cyclotrons cost millions of dollars to install, and existing targets are inefficient.
    \ Low energy cyclotrons are significantly less expensive, and are currently under
    development by multiple commercial companies.  This project seeks to develop a
    novel cyclotron target methodology for producing Carbon-11 at low energies using
    unique nanomaterials, resulting in significantly lower costs.  \n\nThe intellectual
    merit of this project is in the use of novel nanomaterials to produce Carbon-11
    more efficiently and at lower cost, through development of recoil escape targets.
    \ It is challenging to find a good target material suitable for both efficient
    production of Carbon-11, by one of several available nuclear reactions, and efficient
    recovery of the produced radiotracer in a usable form.  The produced Carbon-11
    can be difficult to recover, as it is easily trapped in many conventional target
    materials, resulting in low yields.  Recent advances in nanoscience and technology
    allow for production of novel materials with unique characteristics.  Boron nitride
    nanotubes (BNNT) are composed of fibers with single atomic thickness, or at most
    a few atoms thick, allowing Carbon-11 to be efficiently produced and recovered
    in the form of carbon dioxide gas using low energy cyclotrons.  Prototype production
    targets will be developed and tested at commercial cyclotron sites.  The process
    for collecting the produced Carbon-11 gas will be optimized to achieve the highest
    yields of usable radiotracer material.  Efforts will be made to further develop
    BNNT materials with ideal characteristics, including high purity and optimal density."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is very significant. Suboptimal operational decision-making in emergency departments and hospitals leads to inefficiencies that result in excessive patient wait-times, the diversion of ambulances to other emergency departments, wasted resources and patients who either leave before being treated or against medical advice. By connecting modern analytical approaches, including statistical modeling and systems engineering methods, to real-time data routinely collected by hospitals, the proposed project promises to result in a tremendously valuable analytics platform that will assist administrators in making dozens of operational and staffing decisions each day. This informed decision-making will not only improve hospital efficiency, it will lead to both healthier and more satisfied patients and simultaneous dramatic increases in revenue and profit. The technology proposed will have the potential to add significant value to the approximately 5,000 hospitals in the U.S., often on the order of millions of dollars annually. Hospitals and health systems now realize the value of effective analytics, and the analytics platform proposed here will be an obvious investment for any emergency department or hospital whose goal is to provide the best care to its patients at lower costs.

    The proposed project promises to yield a set of decision-support applications upon which emergency departments and hospitals will base their decisions each day. Substantial investments by hospitals and health systems on information technology, and in particular, electronic health records, have set the stage for evidence-based, data-driven decisions. These decisions will effectively leverage real-time data along with analytical methods such as statistical forecasting and event-simulation modeling. In particular, this proposed project will develop software applications, based on these analytical methods and linking to real-time data sources, tailored to emergency departments and hospitals. This project will involve 1) addressing the real-time needs of hospital operational decision-makers, 2) further developing a statistical and simulation modeling platform to inform these real-time needs, specifically reflecting emergency departments and whole hospitals, and 3) ultimately ensuring that actionable insights are delivered in a timely and intuitive manner to key stakeholders. These actionable insights that derive from the data and sophisticated methods must be delivered to the right decision-maker at the right time and in the right format, but will then have the capacity to substantially improve both the quality and efficiency of care-delivery throughout the hospital.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is the reduction of deaths and long-term disabilities in people suffering from bleeding in the brain caused by intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or traumatic brain injury. Currently, physicians detect worsening bleeding through a clinical exam where a patient shows outward signs of deterioration in their neurological status. By the time these signs of additional bleeding appear, much of the damage to the brain has already occurred. About a third of people who suffer a severe traumatic brain injury either die or are left disabled. For hemorrhagic stroke, 60% die and 70% of survivors are left with significant disabilities. A device which transmits and receives very low power radiofrequency signals has been created that can be put on a patients head. The presence of blood outside of the brain's vessels and arteries creates a characteristic change in the radio signal used by the device. Using radio waves to non-invasively detect brain bleeds will allow treatment to start sooner, which will save lives, reduce disabilities and lower the cost of treating severe brain injuries.

    The proposed project tests (i) the ability of the device to detect and characterize small changes in ICH size and location over time and (ii) the ability to display changes in the bleed in a meaningful way to physicians. An algorithm for determining the size and location of the hemorrhage will be tested using both a phantom model that mimics the human brain and an IACUC-approved pig ICH model. Multiple hemorrhage volumes and locations will be used to test the algorithm's ability to detect hemorrhage volume changes within 1 mL, location within 1 cm, and distinguish changes due to the hemorrhage from physiological changes in a living pig's brain. Signal measurements taken before, during, and after infusion of blood will be captured at each time point to test the accuracy of the algorithm. Software will be developed to display the information from the algorithm in three-dimensions while giving doctors and nurses control over thresholds for triggering an alarm and how often the device scans. To test the software, the data collected during the pig experiments will be used to determine how accurate the display matches the location and size of the hemorrhage from CT images collected during testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to create a suite of consumer hardware and software products that provide realistic tactile feedback to users who are touching objects in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). As evidenced by the current proliferation of low-cost head-mounted displays and motion tracking systems, three-dimensional interaction technologies are revolutionizing how people interact with computers, media, and each other. Since they are currently limited to vision and audio, endowing consumer-level human-computer interfaces with high-fidelity tactile feedback will vastly increase user immersion, making games more fun, online interactions more effective, and tools more efficient. Consequently, this project has the potential to expand the commercial reach of the burgeoning VR/AR market, opening up myriad opportunities for companies particularly in the gaming, entertainment, and e-commerce sectors. The innovation of this project also promises to enhance scientific and technological understanding of haptic human-computer interaction by establishing a new paradigm that blends minimal wearable hardware with sophisticated software algorithms. Finally, commercializing novel interactive technology also has the potential to help inspire a diverse array of young people to pursue a career in the critical areas of science, technology, engineering, and math.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project aims to advance knowledge of low-cost technology that can provide realistic tactile feedback to a user touching objects in VR or AR: the project?s intellectual merits center on testing a new approach that combines minimal haptic hardware and sophisticated software algorithms. The research objective is to create a fully functional industrial prototype of a wearable fingertip thimble and custom software that embody the proposed approach. When the user's finger moves to touch a virtual object, a platform inside the thimble will initiate contact with the fingerpad and press with a force that varies with penetration distance, to render surface softness. A thermal actuator will convey the object?s thermal conductivity and temperature. When the finger slides along a virtual object, the user will feel its texture via carefully designed platform vibrations. Specific research tasks to be addressed include exploring haptic actuator options, building a library of haptic object properties (HOPs) that can be applied to virtual objects, and creating a communication protocol for exchanging haptic signals among devices. This project is expected to yield a fully functional industrial prototype and developer kits for the wearable fingertip thimble.

- abstractText: "This Phase II project impacts the way engineering design is taught
    in design courses and contributes to the training of a strong workforce in areas
    related to science, technology and engineering. The Ecosystem is a software tool
    that automatically verifies designs against the requirements, to uncover oversights
    early in the process, but also fosters engineering judgement and creativity, allows
    for assessment of designs with less subjectivity, and facilitates smooth communication
    among team members. This results in productivity enhancements, higher quality
    designs and shorter time-to-market, but also in societal benefits (safer products,
    less risk of catastrophic accidents and more competitive design organizations).
    The target market consists of (1) educational institutions teaching engineering
    design, and (2) design companies striving to ensure compliance with the design
    specifications.  The core innovation is three-fold.  First, it consists of an
    e-design assessment engine that is being developed to a high degree of sophistication.
    \ Second, design repositories are investigated and developed for integration.
    \ Third, holistic (big data) analysis of design content and metadata is implemented.
    \n\nThe project seeks to develop an innovative design decision (learning) support
    system addressing problems related to the high cost of design oversights. Such
    oversights can result in catastrophic failures, product recalls, or simply in
    budget or schedule over-runs (due to rework).  The Ecosystem offers a flexible,
    yet systematic and generic, framework, for guiding designers through the design
    process, and for automatically assessing design activities, from each stage in
    the design process, against the product design specification (PDS). At the center
    of the Ecosystem is the e-design assessment engine, which decomposes the PDS,
    correlates the design activities against individual requirements, and provides
    real-time advisories in case of design oversights. The assessment engine automatically
    configures popular development tools for engineering design, determines relevant
    analyses, and interprets the outputs. The Ecosystem interfaces with these development
    tools, but does not replace. The Ecosystem can translate qualitative customer
    requirements into solid engineering requirements, and verify the relevance of
    the design content provided through seamless interfaces with industry databases.
    The Ecosystem improves designers' productivity through automation of many administrative
    tasks (e.g., generation of project reports). Despite the automation, the learning
    experience is not diminished. The Ecosystem prompts for, captures, and preserves
    the rationale for relevant engineering decisions. It also supports accredited,
    generic learning objectives for engineering design."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide wireless technology for economic high-speed internet connectivity in under-served rural regions, addressing the needs of 40 million Americans and over 50% of the global population. The technological developments in this project will pave the way for adoption of Massive, or Many-Antenna MIMO technologies in next-generation wireless systems by addressing scalability bottlenecks with innovative hardware and protocol design. The result of this project will be a revolutionary new wireless system for internet service providers addressing an $80 billion fixed wireless systems market and connecting under-served global communities to high-speed internet commerce, communications, education, and entertainment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will develop a production-ready Television White Space (TVWS) Massive MU-MIMO wireless system for IP data traffic, then use it to characterize for the first time diverse, large-scale multi-user TVWS channels. This project will demonstrate the first economically-viable Massive MIMO system, as well as the first point-to-multipoint wireless system capable of non-line-of-sight ranges over 10s of miles with over 2 Gbps of aggregate capacity. The system will be used to measure and characterize TVWS channels at scale in various rural environments, with large beamforming arrays serving tens of clients tens of miles away. In particular, these measurements will explore the effect of range, environment, user separation, and polarization on real-world achievable capacity. The results will be used to guide the design, optimization, and deployment of rural TVWS broadband networks across the world.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will revolutionize the treatment of individuals with autism. One of every sixty-eight US children has autism (over 1.1 million). The estimated cost of providing Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy to those who could benefit is $7.5 billion dollars annually. Societal impacts include: 1) more individuals with autism across the globe will receive treatment regimens that will enable them to live more fulfilled lives and reach their full potential; 2) families whose children are good candidates for treatment and receive it will experience reduced stress and better family life; and 3) the additional lifetime cost of not effectively treating children with autism, which is approximately ten-fold the cost of treatment, will be reduced. Because high-quality, contextually rich ABA performance data will be collected for the first time, efforts to apply data analytics will contribute in two important ways: a) patterns may be discerned across individuals with autism to better understand variations in autism and create therapies to target these differences; b) expansion of the frontiers of data mining to provide guidance in real time will contribute to a number of areas within and beyond ABA therapy.

    The proposed project will optimize therapy outcomes for individuals with autism by transforming agent-based guiding technology into an adaptive and intelligent ABA therapy assistant for supervisors and instructors. The project pushes the boundaries in providing cost-effective, adaptable, intelligent, real-time guidance and data-collection support to instructors that integrates naturally into the instructional process and is easy to learn and use. ABA therapy experts, supervisors and instructors will verify the analyses and resulting guidance incorporated into the technology.  Advanced theories of usability engineering, including some developed by the project team, will be used to build interfaces that supervisors and instructors can intuit without the need for learning new concepts and syntax. The project will utilize the collected logs from multiple sessions with multiple therapy recipients and multiple therapy providers to uncover hidden patterns and assist supervisors in selecting appropriate therapy steps personalized for the individual with autism. The project will build on a large body of recent work in visualization, machine learning on temporal predictive modeling and sequential pattern mining, including some of the previous results of the project team. Special attention will be paid to the recent work in educational data mining and intelligent tutoring.

    This Phase II project is to the first personalized learning platform for hands-on education that works with the billions of mobile devices already in people's hands worldwide. Because the technology works on any mobile device and requires little instructor facilitation, it will be commercially successful in home settings when parents are busy and school settings where budget restrictions limit the number of facilitators. Beyond commercial impact, this project will help address the nation's need to prepare citizens for the 21st century economy, improve science literacy and help provide equal opportunities to underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). This project is an effective teaching tool because it employs personalized learning, where the content and pace of learning are optimized for the individual learner. Personalized learning has already been shown to result in higher learner engagement and increased retention of concepts in educational software. Through the use of proprietary augmented reality and adaptive learning technology, this project brings personalized learning to hands-on STEM education, enabling learners to develop problem solving skills in a more effective, engaging and lower cost way.

    The key innovation in this project is a single software framework combining advanced augmented reality  (AR) and adaptive learning (AL) techniques to capture learners? interactions with real world objects (for example, circuit blocks, fraction bricks or chemistry models) via a mobile device camera, analyze the significance of the interactions and automatically provide personalized guidance to each learner.  The system will be the first to provide a high level API above the complexity of AR and AL, allowing designers of learning experience modules to focus solely on content and user experience instead of hundreds of thousands of lines of complex code associated with AR and AL. The methods employed will be the research, design and development of the augmented reality and adaptive learning engine, its integration with three learning experience modules: circuits, fractions, basic geometry, and an evaluation of the modules. To guide the development, pilot studies utilizing A/B testing with competing approaches, pre and post assessments, and behavioral analysis of users interacting with the system will be conducted periodically.

    deploy and maintain ever more complex underwater hardware, conduct subsea scientific
    sampling and exploration and develop natural resources in hostile, deep and remote
    locations, the need for ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) is increasing. ROVs
    have transitioned from basic transport and inspection tools to mission critical

    high rates of equipment breakage, unpredictable and inefficient task completion
    and high mission overhead. This work is developing innovative products for 3-dimensional
    visual awareness and computer assisted control systems for subsea teleoperated
    robots. Divers can be replaced in hazardous situations by telerobots using this
    technology. The rate of untoward incidents and their severity will be reduced
    for a large range of subsea activities. Economic benefits include reduced costs,
    new employment opportunities, competitive advantages and contributions to the

    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will address fundamental challenges
    of connecting higher-dimensional data from remote environments to intuitive controls.
    Its intellectual merit is the refinement of a collaborative approach to command
    and control allowing ROV pilots to communicate seamlessly with each other and
    the robotic system. This will be done by developing several foundational innovations
    that, separately, enhance capabilities (and may become individual products), and
    that together derive immense value to the customer. These technologies are in
    the areas of: (1) Pilot Interface/Control room software; (2) Sensor fusion and
    processing; (3) Task assistance and workflow management; and (4) Manipulator and
    vehicle control. Successful implementation of visualization, sensor fusion, control
    methods, and haptic virtual fixtures serves as an excellent demonstration example

    learning techniques that allow the system to classify waste at levels approaching
    human performance, with a continual training signal obtained via human supervision.
    These innovations pave the way for a new era in recycling, where waste is sorted

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a new tool revealing important information regarding skeletal muscle strength and health. Muscle weakness is a pervasive problem across our society, including people with joint disease, aging people, obese people, and people with neuromuscular disorders. All of these problems affect muscles across the body in different and non-intuitive ways; however, to date there has not been marketed technology that allows for quantitative measurement of muscle size on a muscle-by-muscle basis and specific analysis to address the muscle weakness problem. Due to the current high cost, the initial targeted customers will be elite athlete organizations, with the goal of using the technology to improve performance as well as to provide more quantitative metrics for predicting injury susceptibility and make return-to-sport decisions. However, with research and development to bring down the cost, the ultimate goal is to make a broadly used clinical tool for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of health conditions related to musculoskeletal disease and mobility, which will have broad societal impact.

    The proposed project will provide a major advancement in image-based modeling and data analysis tools in order to allow high-throughput imaging, rapid and accurate segmentation of muscles and efficient data analysis. Currently, physical therapists, athletic trainers and strength and conditioning coaches only have very blunt tools to assess each individual?s strength and very limited information about the optimal muscle profile. Therefore, training and rehabilitative approaches are developed via experience and trial and error. The technology proposed here solves these problems by making using of an image-to-model pipeline to quantify muscle size and provide valuable and actionable information based on the quantification. However, the obstacles for a wide adoption of this technology include specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols and lengthy image segmentation process. In the previous funding cycle these two problems have been addressed with substantial technology advancements. The proposed activities in this funding cycle will continue the technical development process to further bring down the cost with improved image segmentation process and provide additional value with advanced data analysis. It will ultimately be a revolutionary tool to improve muscle health.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be accomplished through a proprietary technology
    with its extraordinary capability to enable a large number of high-value, hard-to-formulate

    food and supplement industries, this technology may enable the industry to replace
    non-healthy or even hazardous additives, such as artificial colors and preservatives,
    with natural and healthy alternatives, thus greatly contribute to long-term food

    this technology targets is a large number of high-value whereas poorly water-soluble
    active ingredients that have been challenging the drug and food industry for a
    long time. For example, around 80% of drug candidates identified by modern drug
    discovery technologies are poorly water-soluble. For food, a large number of vitamins,
    nutrients, antioxidants, and natural colors are poorly water-soluble. Overall,
    poorly water-soluble compounds constitute an enormous formulation challenge. To
    address this need, this team has created a platform technology that is highly

    to potential customers. This project will be conducted through close collaborations
    among the start-up company, a major university, and a number of major pharmaceutical,
    ingredients, food, and personal care companies. The deliverables of this project
    include the specifications of core material, initial safety evaluations, and prototypes
    provided to customers. This project will support the start-up company to form
    a solid foundation for commercialization and long-term growth."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to create a medical device capable of rapidly guiding treatment to stop bleeding in trauma patients. Trauma can affect the body's ability to form clots to stop bleeding. Of the more than 2 million severe cases of trauma in the U.S., approximately one third will develop a condition: trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC), which increases mortality 4-fold. TIC can be corrected; however, current tests to identify TIC take too long to effectively guide treatment. This leads to sub-optimal care and increased mortality and morbidity. The current standard-of-care to correct TIC is the transfusion of blood products. A patient should only be transfused if necessary because unnecessary transfusions can lead to complications resulting in longer hospital stays and even death. A rapid assay that can evaluate a trauma patient's coagulation status can help guide treatment of their injuries, resulting in improved standard-of-care that can both save lives and healthcare dollars. Yearly trauma rates unfortunately remain stable, and with an addressable market of more than $400M per year in the U.S., the commercial impact for such an assay is significant.

    The proposed project is to develop a rapid assay that provides an individualized assessment of a trauma patient's coagulation status. A significant subset of trauma patients develop impairment to the normal coagulation process as a result of their injuries. Current assays to identify this impairment take too long to effectively guide treatment. Therefore, successful completion of this project will yield a disposable microfluidic card (microcard) that has multiple advantages over current assays, which are slow and non-specific. The microcard will measure clot characteristics currently used by emergency room physicians to guide treatment, but will do so in less than five minutes. This is a critical feature as it quickly guides treatment, meaning that there is time for re-evaluation to determine if treatment is effective. The microcard will also include on-board positive and negative controls that indicate a patient?s individual coagulation profile. This will result in personalized and more accurate treatments that can reduce complications and mortality. The rapid and specific microcard assay will significantly improve care of injured patients while conserving resources and time, ultimately saving money for the U.S. healthcare system.

    The broader impact/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in promoting the protection of human health, the environment, and our nation's natural resources by providing new sensors that enable fast, accurate, cost-effective sampling and analysis tools to monitor pollution and exposure. The innovations developed here will allow for the rapid identification and detection of hazardous compounds in water at substantially reduced cost. These technological innovations will translate into triple bottom-line savings of companies by enhancing our ability to protect people and the planet, while simultaneously providing cost and time savings to the business. The technology embodies the concepts of sustainability and ease of use, and will achieve broad commercial appeal by saving businesses money, time, and effort while also giving them more data on potential sources of pollution. Scientifically, this technology will enable more precise assessment of environmental pollution by providing more rapid measurement capability at a larger scale than is currently possible.


    This project will develop an innovative, market-disruptive technology for measuring toxic metals in water. This technology is inexpensive, portable, and does not require any power or external reading equipment. Furthermore, it can be adapted to a wide range of toxic compounds after initial commercialization around metals analysis. The system costs an order of magnitude less than the current "point of need" technologies capable of quantitative determination of toxic metals in water, and two orders of magnitude less than the traditional laboratory tests. Access Sensor Technologies is a new startup, but the core team has a strong track record in the field of microfluidic paper-based analytical devices for environmental analysis where the proposed system represents a major innovation in the field. The proposal has four technical objectives: (1) Expand the palette of applicable chemistry to include additional metals: cadmium, lead, manganese, and both chromium 3+ and 6+; (2) Test the prototype system in a relevant laboratory environment or in a simulated operational environment; (3) Achieve a successful customer-driven demonstration of the system in the field; and (4) Identify key elements of manufacturability that define the roadmap to production of the system at market scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide a new standard of quantifying touch for industries currently relying on qualitative data from expert sensory panels (the tactile equivalent of professional wine tasters). Advancing the understanding of the role and function of tactile sensing in perception and manipulation is also essential if robots are to behave like humans. Studies have demonstrated that humans who cannot feel due to permanent disease or temporary anesthesia perform poorly in fine manipulation tasks (similar to even the best robotic systems without touch). The research proposed in this project is the next step to bring tactile sensing and sensory-motor intelligence to the next generation of robotics. The successful demonstration of a tactile sensor with perceptual similarity to the human fingertip would mark substantial progress in the field of telemanipulation, bringing the world one step closer to remote haptic perception.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to develop the world's first standard of human tactile perception. It has been proposed that tactile recognition presents a more difficult problem than vision and hearing, requiring not only intelligent sensory processing, but also intelligent algorithms to select and control movements, which have a tremendous influence on what is sensed. Artificial sensors that mimic the mechanical properties and sensitivity of the human fingertip have not existed until recently. The research proposed herein will test hypotheses that a biologically inspired robotic system can measure properties that correspond to subjective percepts, descriptors and associations that humans use to characterize objects by touch.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the automated manufacture of lightweight high-strength carbon fiber composite materials. Experts agree that composite manufacturers must lead innovations in sustainability, price reduction, and cycle-time reduction to meet end-market needs. The innovations proposed in this project, coupled with Vistex Composites' cutting edge Specialized Elastomeric Tooling process, directly address these needs by significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in composites manufacturing equipment. The prevailing motivation for short automated cycles is posed by the automotive industry, where lightweighting delivers major benefits for fuel consumption but where current processes cannot affordably and quickly produce carbon fiber automotive parts in large numbers. The equipment innovations proposed will not only enhance the automotive market but will have substantial commercial value across all composite markets as they allow the manufacture of equivalent quality products, faster, with less waste, significant energy savings, and at lower cost. Furthermore, the proposed automated process will enable Vistex in its aggressive path towards not only broader adoption of its Specialized Elastomeric Tooling process technology but also broader adoption of composite materials. This will directly drive manufacturing job creation, for Vistex and its customers, as composites displace foreign produced goods.


    This project addresses the design, fabrication, and analysis of an automated composite manufacturing cell using Vistex's patented Specialized Elastomeric Tooling process as the central technology. The standard composite manufacturing process, the autoclave, has long cycle times (hours), requires significant manual labor, and is expensive. Vistex's proposed manufacturing cell addresses these concerns. In the proposal manufacturing cell will be designed and fabricated to make a composite product using Specialized Elastomeric Tooling but where parts (1) can be moved rapidly and accurately using automation, (2) rapidly cured using Specialized Elastomeric Tooling, and (3) rapidly ejected/removed from the tooling, all while creating an equivalent or superior product to with significant cycle time savings over the industry's standard autoclave process. Through the use of material testing, cost analysis, and other metrics, each stage of the proposed manufacturing cell will be benchmarked against industry standard processes. The anticipated result will be a prototype turnkey rapid automated manufacturing cell and commercially usable products for project partners.

    and they can face an ever-widening gap to their peers. Formative assessment (FA)
    practices have been well established as effective in closing these gaps and informing

    student understanding and to analyze the learning process, enabling additional
    research into effective practices for the teaching and learning of mathematics.
    With its strong customer value propositions and innovations that will enable new

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to develop a system to dramatically simplify how course content is shared, discovered, curated and managed in educational institutions. The vast majority of content in educational institutions is in multiple silo-ed repositories. Hence, compliance tracking, aligning curricula with competencies and course authoring are manual and expensive processes. This project aims to unlock these silos and make it simple to search, tag and curate courseware at topic-level across multiple platforms. The technology also extracts student feedback and assessment information and maps it against granular learning objectives to provide new insights to track and improve learning outcomes. By unlocking courseware stuck in silo-ed college systems, this project facilitates a cross-institutional marketplace that enables any institution to share and/or monetize curated high quality content, and conversely have access to curated course packs that may be taught by adjunct faculty, a $2B market opportunity. Simplifying faculty access to Open Educational Resources and curated learning content from other colleges will help drive down student course-pack costs significantly.

    The key technical innovation in this project is seamless extraction of learning content from multiple educational repositories coupled with a syllabus-driven semantically intelligent search and recommendation engine woven into the course curation process. Developing an abstracted mechanism to interface with different types of learning management systems and other repositories, and making it portable without requiring a common content format is a significant innovation. Natural Language Processing techniques combined with curated controlled vocabularies and taxonomies are applied to simplify curation of a course, notably automatic topic identification and instructional tagging. The curation data is leveraged in the semantic search engine to improve recommendation of courseware during course authoring. The goal of the adaptive recommendation engine is to improve discovery and usage of both open educational resources and courseware developed in other colleges, without requiring expensive professional services. Another goal of the project is to extract student feedback seamlessly using IMS defined standards regardless of which learning management system is used to deliver the content. The student feedback, assessment data, grades and other information pulled from various college systems are then correlated to provide rich analytics and visibility of student outcomes and alignment of courseware with competencies.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is multi-fold: First, the proposed tripolar concentric
    ring electrode and instrumentation for acquiring brain signals, tripolar electroencephalography
    (tEEG), is a platform technology that has a variety of medical and commercial
    applications. By providing significantly clearer brain signals, tEEG will resolve
    conventional EEG?s major drawback of poor signal quality that clinicians and researchers
    have been struggling with for decades. tEEG can advance diagnosis and fill unmet
    clinical and research needs such as detection of biomarkers to quantify various
    neurological disorders. Second, commercially, tEEG can transform the market landscape
    and set a new standard for EEG equipment. The fundamental improvement promised
    by tEEG and its non-invasive nature are particularly appealing. tEEG could greatly
    simplify and advance the diagnosis of a wide spectrum of neurological disorders
    (epilepsy, sleep disorders, stroke, Parkinson?s, Alzheimer?s, etc.) and more effectively
    guide neurosurgical and other medical procedures. Third, the fundamental improvement
    in spatial resolution and artifacts rejection in EEG signals will help advance
    the understanding of brain activity, leading to new discoveries in the research
    of various brain diseases and neurological disorders. \n\nThe proposed project
    aims to develop a portable tripolar concentric ring electrode (TCRE) electroencephalography
    (tEEG) recording system and perform a comprehensive clinical evaluation to demonstrate
    that tEEG can detect certain important brain EEG signals better than conventional
    EEG. EEG is the primary diagnostic tool for epilepsy, the most common serious
    brain disorder worldwide, but misdiagnosis occurs in up to 50% of the patients.
    Artifact contamination seriously hinders the effectiveness of EEG and is a root
    cause of misdiagnosis. tEEG automatically suppresses artifacts and increases the
    interpretability of EEG through two inventions: (1) a transformative electrode
    configuration - the TCRE; and (2) the proprietary tEEG Interface and digitizer.
    The TCRE, tEEG Interface, and digitizer together comprise a complete, Portable
    tEEG system with the data stored and displayed on a laptop. In this project, clinicians
    will evaluate tEEG against conventional EEG in areas such as usability, ability
    to suppress artifacts, and superiority in seizure detection. If successful, tEEG
    would generate intense interest in the field because of the significant clinical
    and research impact. We expect that comparing tEEG and EEG in a clinical setting
    will demonstrate the superiority of tEEG for diagnosing epilepsy."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to make the 'green' solar industry truly green. As the deployment of solar modules expands rapidly, so will module wastes. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that module wastes will appear in large quantities by early 2030's and by 2050 they will total 78 million tonnes. Today most module wastes end up in landfills. This SBIR project will develop a technology to maximize the revenue from module recycling. It has the potential to enable a profitable recycling business without any government subsidy. By recovering all the valuable components in modules, our technology has the potential to generate up to $60 billion in revenue from 78 million tonnes of modules.

    The proposed project develops sustainable recycling processes and related equipment for silicon solar cells and modules. The goal of the project is to separate and recover all the valuable, toxic, and bulky components in cells and modules including solar-grade silicon, silver, lead, copper, aluminum, tin, and glass. The target for solar-grade silicon recovery is 85% and the target for metal recovery, especially silver, is over 90%. The revenue from recycling, based on today's prices for solar-grade silicon and silver, is $15/module by our technology, as compared to $3.50/module by today's technology. The primary work of this project will be developing a prototype for silicon solar cell recycling and optimizing the process for a production environment. The target throughput of the prototype is up to 50 kg of solar cell wastes per day.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    This project proposes to develop an innovative approach to improve and sustain math educators' problem solving teaching skills. Despite the expectations placed on math teachers by the Common Core State Standards, most are insufficiently prepared to teach students how to become critical thinkers. Much of this problem is due to limited pedagogical skills of teachers in providing adequate problem solving instruction and supports on top of teachers' own limited problem solving skills. This project remedies this with its integrated modules and powerful analytics engine that suggests learning pathways for both expert and novice teachers. They anchor their research in National Council of Teacher's of Mathematics Principles to Action. It will help teachers develop confidence and skills in planning and evaluating their lessons, as well as understanding student misconceptions and intervening in a timely manner. Teachers who approach problem solving with confidence inspire students to approach difficult math tasks the same way. This has great implications for how many students will continue to enroll in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math programs. In addition, the project sets the stage for educators to develop 21st Century skills including critical thinking, communication and collaboration - essential job skills for the young minds they mentor.

    This effort refines and scales up their product, which is a web and mobile application that works seamlessly in conjunction with our current student-facing platform, to provide teachers with timely supports for improving students' problem-solving skills and math communication. This project will deliver professional development continuously and in-context using virtual peers, rich rubrics, interactive tools and actionable data. The analytics engine leverages adaptive learning models in order to build robust modules. The Data Collector Layer will contain interfaces for users to get recommendations, receive user feedback and provide other analysis reports. The Analytics Core Layer will be implemented using a collection of machine learning algorithms. The Service Layer will calculate recommendations based on user profile, user feedback, pre-stored best practices and other use cases. The Persistence Layer will store and get calculated data to recommendation engine's own database. The company plans to conduct several formative evaluations during the course of the project, as well as two pilot studies at the end of each year with a control and experiment group. The results will enable them to determine the effectiveness of ongoing, just-in-time supports for improving teachers' skills and confidence inside and outside the classroom.

- abstractText: "This project creates an educational, touchscreen-based software that
    translates visual educational content into accessible, multisensory content for
    students with special needs, and particularly those with blindness and visual
    impairments. Consider the challenge in the educational landscape today: schools
    are increasingly adopting digital tools oriented toward creating a more interactive,
    personalized experience for mainstream students, but at the same time, are struggling
    to accommodate their diverse student population, particularly, the 6 million students
    in special education in the U.S. This problem is exaggerated in Science, Technology,
    Engineering, and Math (STEM), where content is often complex and visual. This
    project addresses these challenges, building on what we already know about human
    information processing and haptic interfaces to create software that will automatically
    convert highly visual content into content that can be seen, heard, and felt in
    real-time in class. This project supports NSF?s mission ensuring that inclusion
    of all students is at the forefront of the digital transformation of U.S. classrooms.
    The societal impacts of this work overcome several barriers impeding students
    with special needs from being independent and active contributors in the STEM
    educational experience and ultimately, many STEM professions. ViTAL projects a
    direct, financial return on investment for taxpayers within three years of operations,
    generating both revenue and new jobs, with plans to multiply this growth year
    over year. \n\n\nThe innovation in this project is the creation of methods and
    algorithms for effective translation of visual content into multimodal content,
    appropriately down sampled for the nonvisual sensory channels yet effective in
    conveying the most meaningful information. Such a conversion currently does not
    exist, which results in high overhead costs to create accessible graphics and
    is a major pain point in special education, particularly for individuals with
    visual impairments or blindness. Further, translating graphical content from the
    visual to the multimodal (visual, auditory, and haptic) space is not a straightforward
    conversion due to the limited bandwidth of human touch compared to vision and
    the complexity of features presented in graphical information. This challenge
    is exaggerated when accounting for the varying types of haptic feedback that can
    be provided from varying platforms (Android and iOS). This project addresses these
    challenges, creating a streamlined solution for generating accessible, multisensory
    content, in real-time, on commercial platforms for K-12 classrooms. The outcomes
    of this project will (1) create the algorithms needed to provide an automated
    conversion from the visual to multimodal space, (2) establish a teacher \"dashboard\"
    to streamline the proposed software?s integration in the classroom, and (3) expand
    the software to the iOS market while simultaneously uncovering novel haptic effects
    that leverage Apple?s unique Taptic feedback. Upon completion of the development,
    the software will be beta tested with partnering schools, and then released on
    both Android and iOS markets."

    This project will improve the awareness and perception of careers that require science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) competencies. Advocacy is a critical component of career readiness, yet current advocates (parents, guardians, educators, or members of the community) are often not in the position to inform students of potential career options. Career and workforce readiness programs are resource constrained, don't meet the needs of differing learning styles, have inherent bias, and are largely focused on compliance over student competency building. Many underrepresented youths who would otherwise succeed in STEM are often deterred by a lack of role models. If youth understood the opportunities, they could pursue academic pathways to amass skills that better prepare them to enter the workforce. Furthermore, educators need professional learning experiences and access to insights about their students in order to improve STEM teaching and learning. Helping individuals select rewarding and suitable degrees, training, and careers will increase the likelihood of higher job retention. As more individuals are inspired to pursue and stay in STEM, taxpayers will benefit from increased innovation which in turn will provide tax dollars to invest in such things as healthcare, national security, education, or humanitarian assistance.

    The project will address technical challenges of amassing and distributing massive amounts of 3rd party STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) resource data (both structured and unstructured), developing an information management system for educators and families, developing adaptive learning skill modules, advancing a second generation smart recommendation engine based on big data, machine learning and predictive modeling techniques, and performing database mining and creating data visualizations to derive meaningful workforce development insights. In addition, the project will involve controlled experiments and usability tests whereby a large amount of anonymized and aggregated student data and business/education entity feedback will be collected. The ultimate goals of the R&D and experiments are to validate that the resulting application, predictive models, information management practices, advocacy networks, and data visualizations have the desired outcome of boosting immediate and near-term student outcomes regarding STEM career intentions and actions.

    This project will address the need for accessible, creative music education. Over 90% of Americans believe music education is valuable, but very few people ever learn enough to create their own music. Instrument lessons are a great way for some beginners to learn about music; however, instrument lessons are expensive and difficult, and focus on performance and technique at the expense of creativity. This project uses a simple audiovisual composition interface to empower music learners to create their own original music on mobile devices from the very beginning of their music education. By combining this intuitive composition interface with data tracking and analysis, this project creates the opportunity to provide music makers with personalized, adaptive feedback as they compose. Currently, $3 billion are spent each year in the United States on instrument lessons, even though they are unaffordable for many potential customers. By leveraging the proliferation of mobile devices worldwide, this project will deliver an accessible, low-cost digital music education option, creating a new market that includes customers who are currently priced out. Expanding participation in creative music education will increase the quantity and quality of music composed worldwide, while also building a sustainable, revenue-generating business and creating new jobs.

    Through data-driven agile software development, this project will address the need for accessible music education through the creation of a technology platform that delivers adaptive learning to musical beginners. Because the platform upon which this project is built is already empowering the creation of thousands of songs each week and collecting usage data from live users, this project is uniquely positioned to tackle the complex problem of providing algorithmic feedback on creative work at scale. Research and development will proceed in four stages: (1) expanding internal tools to allow for direct analysis of the thousands of songs being created on the platform each week; (2) developing an algorithmic approach to analyzing songs and reporting the results to users; (3) applying analysis to match users with relevant communities and collaborators; and (4) implementing adaptive learning approaches to help users more effectively learn to create music. This staged development process will result in an innovative and highly differentiated technology that enables beginners with no musical experience to compose their own music, and uses data to actively support their individual needs as they learn.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project aims to engineer microbes for the cost-effective production of specialty chemicals. Currently, engineered microbial strains bear mutations that increase the production of chemicals of interest by inhibiting the cell's ability to produce off pathway chemicals. These "loss-of-function" mutations are critical as they effectively channel the cell's metabolic flux toward the product of interest. This both boosts the production efficiency and eases downstream purification by eliminating the accumulation of undesirable but chemically-similar contaminants. Unfortunately, these mutations may also decrease the fitness of the cells and, as a result, the growth media must be supplemented with costly nutrients. Technical research herein will assess the feasibility of applying novel regulated proteolysis technology to simultaneously direct maximal metabolic flux toward the target chemical of interest while avoiding the need to supplement the growth media. If successful, this technology would provide a great cost savings and enable fermentative production to be applied more broadly in the production of specialty chemicals.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide a stable and cost-effective fermentative production route to a specialty chemical.  Fermentative production of chemicals offers many advantages over traditional petrochemical or extraction-based production processes.  Petrochemical production maintains the nation?s reliance on an unsustainable feedstock (oil) and also leads to national security issues as the US is largely dependent on foreign oil sources.  Chemical production via extraction from plant materials also has ecological challenges.  The process often uses toxic solvents, and may rely on unsustainable farming practices for many plants that are not traditional food crops.  Engineered microbes fermented on sugar feedstock produced using high-efficiency agricultural practices offer a stable alternative for producing specialty chemicals, both in terms of supply and price.

    The intellectual merit of this proposal is that this program allows highly educated scientists and engineers to acquire real-life research experience and to bring the latest innovative theories and techniques from the academic community o the country?s entrepreneurial technology sector. By working in a cutting-edge laboratory where research and development are accomplished within a framework of expected business outcomes and business constraints, researchers learn to work in multidisciplinary teams and to apply their academic expertise to the important work of product development and application in a globally competitive environment. The small businesses benefit from the fresh insights and most current technological skills and training that the recent postdoctoral students would bring. The program puts those skills and that training to work at creative and inventive research companies which otherwise would not be able to afford such expertise. These pairings would provide active SBIR Phase II companies the opportunity to enhance innovative collaboration, strengthen scientific rigor, and quicken the pace of technological breakthrough. Fellows are also encouraged to publish their work within the overall publishing guidelines set by each participating company.


    The broader impact of this program is to broaden participation of underrepresented groups such as women, African
    Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, and Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders in small high-tech companies supported by the NSF SBIR/STTR program. ASEE has proposed stronger outreach strategies than implemented in the current grant to increase visibility and diversity by reaching out to institutions that supply a high number of candidates from underrepresented demographic groups. ASEE is strengthening its outreach by attending postdoctoral and professional organizational conferences that typically target women and underrepresented groups in STEM fields and by having a proactive presence in social media.
