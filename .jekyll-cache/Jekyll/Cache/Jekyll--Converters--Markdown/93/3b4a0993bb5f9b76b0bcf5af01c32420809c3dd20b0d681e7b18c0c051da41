    <p>Create-a-thons bring people together to develop tangible digital content that organizations can use to amplify their existing Census outreach efforts.
<br /><br />
At these engaging workshops, creative students and professionals collaborate with nonprofit and civic organizations to reach hard-to-count communities in their area. In an action-packed session that can run from 2 hours to a full day, participants learn about the importance of getting out the count, connect with other organizations working to reach hard-to-count communities, and generate a bank of content to support 2020 Census outreach efforts.</p>
