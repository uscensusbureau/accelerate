## 1. Proposal Overview

### Were you invited to submit a proposal?

NSF SBIR/STTR Program Phase I applicants are now **REQUIRED** to submit a three-page “Project Pitch” that outlines the project objectives, technical innovation and associated technical risks. Projects that seem to be a good fit will be officially **INVITED** to submit a full proposal, and all Project Pitch submitters will receive feedback within three weeks. 

Only SBIR/STTR proposals that have been invited will be reviewed by NSF. To learn more about the Project Pitch, please visit [How to Apply]({{ site.baseurl }}/apply/). 

### Read the SBIR/STTR Solicitation

The Phase I [{{ site.data.solicitations['SBIR'].title }}]({{ site.data.solicitations['SBIR'].url }}) and [{{ site.data.solicitations['STTR'].title }}]({{ site.data.solicitations['STTR'].url }}) solicitations explain what information should go in the proposal. The following steps will walk through the process of submitting a proposal to FastLane, one of NSF’s electronic proposal submission systems.

SBIR/STTR Proposals must be submitted to NSF via FastLane. The NSF’s Research.gov proposal preparation and submission site is not currently available for SBIR and STTR proposal submissions.
