# What is the 'Get Out The Count' Video Challenge?
This is a nationwide call for the most impactful, accurate, inspiring, funny, creative, and culturally relevant videos to educate the masses about the 2020 Census and mobilize communities to respond, reminding them that [it’s not too late to self-respond](http://2020census.gov/) online, by phone or by mail.

</div>
<div class="usa-width-three-fourths" markdown="1">
## The format

The challenge will focus on short-format video content—30 seconds to 3 minutes in length— for social platforms like YouTube, with the goal of informing the public about the importance of the census, and activating them to self-respond.

The U.S. Census Bureau will be awarding a total of $50,000 for video submissions that can encourage hard to count communities to fill out the Census.

## Why is it important?
The results of the 2020 Census will determine how congressional representation and billions of dollars in federal funding are distributed to states and cities for schools, roads, hospitals and more.

Some [hard-to-count](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/director/2018/11/counting_everyoneon.html) communities such as racial and ethnic minorities, young and mobile populations, and families with young children could miss out on their fair share, but we can help change that.

# FAQ’s

### 1. How has the COVID-19 affected the Census or this Prize Challenge?

Most people have already received a mailer from the U.S. Census Bureau with information about how to complete the Census online at [2020census.gov](http://2020census.gov/).  Encourage those who have received their invitation to respond online as soon as they receive it.

**Key message to incorporate into videos: It has never been easier to respond on your own, either online, by phone, or by mail, without having to meet a census taker.**

The U.S. Census Bureau has released statements on its [response to COVID-19](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020/statement-coronavirus.html), and [announced modifications to Group Quarters operations](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020/modifying-2020-operations-for-counting-college-students.html), which counts people in nursing homes, college dorms, prisons and other institutional living facilities. Please check back [here for additional news and details](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-kits/2020/covid-19-census-bureau.html) on the 2020 Census and COVID-19.

By March 20th, most households will receive the first of several mailed invitations to respond. **Everyone is encouraged to respond online, via phone or by mail, as soon as they receive their invitation** with the provided instructions and web address for the online questionnaire ([my2020census.gov](http://my2020census.gov/)). Filling out the census now will reduce the chances of an enumerator knocking on your door in the future.

We want you to remain socially distanced and are understanding that videos will be limited to what can be produced while at home. Judges will keep that at the top of their minds.

### 2. Which hashtag or URL should I direct people to? 

Please direct viewers to [2020census.gov](http://2020census.gov/), or to call 1-844-330-2020 (English) or 1-844-468-2020 (Spanish).
