# Phase II reporting

All reporting is administered through Research.gov. Please see [Research.gov reporting information](http://www.research.gov/research-portal/appmanager/base/desktop?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=research_page_n_about_por) for technical guidance and tips on the submission process. Contact the Research.gov help desk by email at [rgov@nsf.gov](mailto:rgov@nsf.gov) or call 1-800-381-1532. The requirements expected for the SBIR/STTR program are detailed below.


Phase II grantees must submit Interim Progress Reports, and a Phase II Final Report. Interim reports must be submitted within 30 days after each six month period. Research.gov indicates that the Interim Progress Reports are optional. However, **please disregard this statement as Interim Project Reports are a requirement of all Phase II awards**. The Phase II Final Report is required to be submitted 90 days following the expiration of the grant. Final payments will not be made and pending future proposals will not be processed until any overdue final reports are submitted and approved.   

Note: No-cost extensions do not change the requirement for six month interim reports. For grant guidance please reference the appropriate link: [Phase I](http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=sbiri212) or [Phase II](http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=sbirii212).  

Note: The Interim Report (IPR) reporting period is autopopulated to include only the date that the report was created (e.g., 05/01/2013 - 05/01-2013). This is a problem with the system that you cannot correct; please proceed with the report as normal.  

If the instructions on this website conflict with instructions provided to you by NSF via email or another NSF web page, the instructions on this page supercede all other instructions!

## Interim Report

(Interim Progress Reports are used for reporting progress typically at the 6, 12, and 18 month performance periods). Note: If you receive a Phase IIB supplement, you are required to provide progress reports, typically at six-month intervals until the grant ends. Phase II progress reports must be submitted through Research.gov.

Under the standard payment schedule for Phase II grants (typically 24-months), one report is required within one month after the end of each respective progress period.

## Phase II/IIB final report

The electronic submission of the Final Report fulfills the NSF reporting requirements for an SBIR/STTR Phase II/IIB grant. The Final Report should be submitted within 90 days following the end date of the award. Each Final Report has four components.
