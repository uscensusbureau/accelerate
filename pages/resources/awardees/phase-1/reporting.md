# Reporting requirements

As a Phase I SBIR/STTR awardee, you need to provide formal reports on two different occasions: 1) when the Phase I award period ends, and 2) when you submit your Phase II proposal (if you choose to do so). The two reports are fairly similar, but need to be submitted at different times and through different electronic systems. See details on each requirement below.

Research.gov administers this reporting requirement. Please visit [Research.gov Reporting Information](http://www.research.gov/research-portal/appmanager/base/desktop?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=research_page_n_about_por) for technical guidance and tips on the submission process. Contact the Research.gov help desk by email at [rgov@nsf.gov](mailto:rgov@nsf.gov) or call 1-800-381-1532. Reporting requirements for the SBIR/STTR program are described below.

The instructions on this page supersede all others; please keep this in mind if you received instructions that conflict with those that follow.

## 1. Complete your cover page

__To be uploaded as a single PDF__

The PI and the Authorized Company Representative must complete and sign the report cover page. Once the cover page is completed and signed, you must attach it as part of the interim report following these steps:

- Make sure you have [Adobe Reader](https://www.nsf.gov/help/plugins.jsp).
- Download the [Cover Page Document]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/files/awardees/SBIR-STTR_Revised_Report_Cover.pdf).
- Fill out and print the form.
- Physically sign the Cover Page (signature field).
- Scan the Cover Page as a PDF file.

(Note: You must sign the cover page because you are certifying that all information contained in the report is accurate.)

## 2. Complete your technical narrative

__To be uploaded as a single PDF__

The technical narrative documents your Phase I research accomplishments and can't exceed 15 pages. The narrative must include the following components:

- A summary of the research you've carried out, your results so far, and the activities to be carried out for the remainder of the Phase I project (if applicable).
- A description of the problems you've encountered and how you resolved them.
- A description of problems you have yet to solve or unfilled research objectives.
- The conclusions of your Phase I findings and how these conclusions support a Phase II proposal.

## 3. Submit your report via Research.gov

- Use your FastLane UserID and password to [log in to Research.gov](https://identity.research.gov/sso/UI/Login?realm=/research&spEntityID=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.research.gov%2Fsso%2Fsp&module=nsf&goto=http%3A%2F%2Fidentity.research.gov%3A80%2Fsso%2Fidpssoinit%3FNameIDFormat%3Durn%3Aoasis%3Anames%3Atc%3ASAML%3A2.0%3Anameid-format%3Atransient%26metaAlias%3D%2Fresearch%2Fidp%26spEntityID%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.research.gov%2Fsso%2Fsp%26binding%3Durn%3Aoasis%3Anames%3Atc%3ASAML%3A2.0%3Abindings%3AHTTP-POST%26RelayState%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.research.gov%2Fresearch-portal%2Fredirect.jsp%3FTARGET%3Dproperty%3A%3ArpprApplicationUrl)
- From the Project Reporting Dashboard, navigate to the appropriate award and report. The Phase I Final Report should be listed in the *Reports Due* tab.
- Provide the *Cover* information.
- Complete the appropriate fields in the *Products* and *Participants* tabs.

This structured information is vital —-- please supply it using the HTML questions and check boxes (regardless of whether or not you've included the same information in a supplementary PDF).

- (Optional) Complete the *Accomplishments*, *Impact*, *Changes/Problems*, and *Special Requirements* sections or use the check boxes to indicate that you have nothing to report.
- Upload the Cover Page PDF in the *Special Requirements* section (under Supporting Files). If the *Special Requirements* tab isn't visible, please upload your Cover Page PDF in the *Accomplishments* section.
- Upload the Technical Narrative PDF in the *Accomplishments* section (under Supporting Files).

## Reporting requirements: Phase II proposal submission

If you're interested in seeking Phase II funding, you'll need to submit your Phase II proposal through FastLane during the Phase II proposal submission process, which may occur before or after your Phase I project ends.

One requirement of this process is submitting an updated Technical Narrative (of no more than 15 pages) that follows the same format described above. Please include this narrative as a supplementary document to your Phase II proposal. See the [Phase II proposal preparation instructions page]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/awardees/phase-2/instructions/) for more details.
