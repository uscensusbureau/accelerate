# Revised budget

To successfully submit a revised budget request to NSF, both a project's PI and sponsored research officer must send in the revision.

All revised budget requests must include a `Revised Budget Justification`, which you can upload or enter using the Budget Impact Statement module (step #10 in the instructions that follow).

## How to prepare a revised budget

1. On the [FastLane website](http://www.fastlane.nsf.gov), click the `Proposals, Awards, & Status` link (left-hand side of the page).

2. Enter your login information into the `PI/Co-PI Login` field and log in.

3. Click the `Proposal Functions` link.

4. Click the `Revised Submitted Proposal Budget` link.

5. Highlight your proposal and click the `View` button.

6. You'll be taken to the `Principal Investigator (PI)/Co-Principal Investigator (Co-PI) Proposal Revised Budget` page. Click the radio button next to `Edit the Budget` and then click OK.

7. `Year One` will appear under the Year column next to the organization name. To edit the budget for year one, click `Funds`.

8. The year one budget will display onscreen, and you'll be able to make any changes you need to. Once you've made your changes, click `Calculate and Save`.

9. Repeat steps seven and eight to revise additional years' budgets, if needed.

10. Now you need to upload your new or revised Budget Justification. From the main `Project Budget` page, upload your entire revised budget justification (including supporting documentation) using the `Budget Impact Statement` module.


At this point, you still haven't submitted your budget to NSF. Please read the instructions on "How to submit a revised budget” to learn how to complete the process.

## How to submit a revised budget

Please note that the SRO (and no one else) must submit the revised budget.

1. Return to the `Principal Investigator (PI)/Co-Principal Investigator (Co-PI) Proposal Revised Budget` page and select the radio button next to `Forward Budget Revision to Sponsored Research Office (SRO)`. Click OK.

2. Click `Forward`.

3. Return to the [FastLane homepage](https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/) and click on the `Research Administration` link.

4. Enter your login information into the `Research Administration` field and log in.

5. Click `Forwarded/Submitted Revised budget`.

6. Highlight the budget under the Forwarded Revised Budgets box and click `Submit`.


## How to add a subaward budget to the revised budget

1. Return to the `Project Budget` screen and click `Add Another Organization`.

2. In the blank field, type the first few characters of the subaward organization's name. Set the radio button to `Contains` and select `Search by Name`. If you know the new organization's DUNS number, you may also search by DUNS.

3. The next screen will display your search results. Select the organization's name and click `Select`.

4. On the next screen, select your subawardee PI by highlighting their name and clicking `Select Subcontract PI`. If the name of the person you'd like to designate as the subaward PI isn't in your list, follow the directions under `How to add an individual as a Senior Personnel` (which appears later on this page).

5. Click `OK`.

6. The subaward organization's name will now appear on the `Project Budget` screen under your organization's name. To edit the subaward organization's budget, refer to `How to Prepare a Revised Budget`.

## How to change the budget's subaward PI

1. Return to the `Principal Investigator (PI)/Co-Principal Investigator (Co-PI) Proposal Revised Budget` page and select the `Edit the Budget` radio button. Click `OK`.

2. Highlight the organization that needs the subaward PI changed and click `Change SubContract PI`.

3. On the next screen, select your subaward PI by highlighting their name and clicking `Select Subcontract PI`. If the name of the person you'd like to designate as the subaward PI isn't in your list, follow the directions under `How to add an individual as a Senior Personnel`.

## How to add an individual as senior personnel

1. Return to the `Principal Investigator (PI)/Co-Principal Investigator (Co-PI) Proposal Revised Budget` screen.

2. Select the radio button next to `Add/Delete Senior Personnel`.

3. Enter the person's name and select `Add Non Co-PI Senior Person to Proposal`. Repeat if necessary.
