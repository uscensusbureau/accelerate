Recent technological advancements in materials science and bioengineered systems have made inexpensive, powerful, and ubiquitous sensing a reality. Examples range from truly smart airframes and self-evaluating buildings and infrastructure for natural hazard mitigation to large-scale weather forecasting, self-organizing energy systems, and smart devices that self-assemble into networks leading to the first electronic nervous system that connects the internet back to the physical world. Proposals are sought in new sensing modalities, self-powered and energy efficient sensors, sensors for extreme environments, sensor fabrication techniques such as 3D printing and self-assembly, sensor signal read out, conditioning, and processing, and biodegradable sensors. For sensor systems and algorithms, tomographic processing, 3D array, autonomous sensing, sensor fusion, extreme environment materials sensing, and remote sensing parametric inversion are of interest.
