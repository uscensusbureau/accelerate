  <h1 class="sticky">Where We Started - Census Solutions Workshops</h1>
    <p>The Census Solutions Workshop evolved from the practice of design thinking, a common methodology in the technology and business world that has been increasingly adopted across the public sector to create impactful solutions to social challenges.</p>
    <p>The Census Open Innovation Labs team began using this set of tools with a group of partners at a conference, as a way to bring diverse people together to generate new ideas for campaigns, media, and activities to help Get Out the Count for the 2020 Census.</p>
    <p>At this workshop, very innovative ideas started to emerge that produced real outcomes; for example:
    <p>A neighbor-to-neighbor toolkit for spreading awareness of the census.</p>
    <p>A toolkit and campaign to engage local libraries in the census count, focusing on people experiencing homelessness.</p>
    <p>A teen census ambassador program.</p>
    <p>A census “Get Out the Count” campaign block party for local activation.</p>
    <p>Soon, we designed, tested, and iterated a series of standalone events -- sometimes attended by as many as 100 people -- that could be adapted for different locations, environments, and groups of people across the country.
    <p>“In these workshops, people who never saw themselves as creative started to discover a childlike playfulness in generating new ideas around the census. We use different exercises to turn off the filter that often tells people that their ideas are crazy or bad, thus opening a new space of possibilities, especially when combined with other ideas from people who are different from them.” - mara</p>
    <p>Other partners, Complete Count Committees, and program areas of the Census Bureau started adopting these workshops. Demand eventually became so high that we “trained the trainer” -- guiding new facilitators in and outside the Census Bureau to run CSWs themselves -- and published a toolkit that was downloaded XX times. The two partnership programs at the U.S. Census Bureau, the National Partnerships Program (NPP) and Community Partnerships and Engagement (CPEP), adopted them as a core part of how they engage with partners.</p>
    <p>Since then, hundreds of CSWs have been instituted, resulting in thousands of new ideas and partnerships.</p>
