        <h3>Civic Alliance</h3>

        <p>Census Accelerate diversified its impact strategy by collaborating with the private sector. We worked with Civic Alliance -- a nonpartisan group of businesses working together on wide scale civic participation in order to focus on what companies can do to get out the count.</p>

        <p>In March 2020, Census Accelerate teamed up with Civic Alliance to run a 2020 Census sprint -- a process to accelerate actionable outcomes -- in order to engage multiple national consumer brands and tech platforms that could reach large numbers of citizens and encourage them to participate in the 2020 census. Over the course of the sprint, each company developed a product, campaign, or feature, intended to reach their customers and/or employees. Experts within and outside the U.S. Census Bureau were made available to advise member companies throughout the sprint. Participating companies were invited to publicly share their sprint plans and ideas. As a result of changes necessitated by the COVID pandemic, the scheduled event was cancelled. However, to date, we catalyzed collaborations with the following companies:</p>

        <h3>Digital Action Weekend</h3>
        <p>In May 2020, Census Accelerate joined forces with CPEP and NPP on a national day of digital action to activate influencers, celebrities and partners at once. This was in an effort to create a unified and concentrated drumbeat in pushing creative census content out online. The weekend focused on two distinct but related efforts: 1) celebrity/influencer activation & 2) Tweet-a-thon (Census Accelerate) that was rolled up into a single weekend event from May 1-3. </p>
        <p>We worked with Twitter and Census Counts for a day of digital action to deploy over 500 pieces of content from creativesforthecount.org and partner content. In addition, CPEP/NPP activated influencers and celebrities by leveraging the support from governors, trusted voices, SCCCs, CCCs and other partners to achieve a groundswell of content distribution and make #2020Census trend on Twitter.</p>

        <p>Due to the enormous success of Digital Action Weekend, there was a spike for #creativeforthecount and the Get Out the Count Video Challenge distribution, generating thousands of visits to the challenge.gov website (total of 103,182 since March 23) that inevitably drove up our submissions rate. Promotion of census content was seen across  Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram. Over four hundred new posts were generated on Facebook alone, with the most engaging post and most viewed video from the School District of Palm Beach County, generating over 4,600 views.</p>
        <p>	In addition, as a result of this massive push, over one thousand new users visited our accelerate.census.gov website and over two thousands new users utilized the content on the creativesforthecount.org website.</p>

        <p>The Opportunity Project (TOP), also led by Census Open Innovation Labs (COIL), brings together government agencies, technology teams, and community organizations to address national challenges powered by federal open data. In 2020, Census Accelerate  recruited technology teams and community groups and facilitated a collaborative process for building digital tools that focused on enumerator recruitment, the digital divide, digital literacy, and reaching hard-to-count communities.</p>

        <p class="bold">We recruited over twelve technology organizations including Measure of America, Next Day Better and Voatz and ten community organizations including Civic Georgia, Color of Challenge, United  Way and Univision to work together to develop two digital products that address some of the major challenges of census operations and outreach.</p>

        <p>For America’s Children, City of Baltimore, Civic Georgia, Hispanic Technology and Telecommunications Partnership (HTTP), Color of Change, State Voices, United Way, National Association of Latino Elected Officials (NALEO), UnidosUS,  Univision and more.</p>

        <h3>Combating Misinformation with Big Tech</h3>

        <p>Census Accelerate partnered with Big tech companies  about the importance of communicating to the public accurate information about the 2020 Census and protecting it from interference. Census Accelerate and partners led a concerted effort to address misinformation shared on social media platforms. </p>

        <p>In the spring and fall of 2019, Census Accelerate launched a series of convenings that brought together technology experts and civic leaders invested in successful digital strategies for the 2020 Census. At the Civic Digital Strategy Workshop at Facebook’s Washington,  DC offices, we convenedalong with Twitter, Google, and other civil society groups, These convenings focused on technology, civil society, and social platforms' roles in informing the public about the importance of being counted.</p>

        <p>The Civic Digital Strategy series consisted of three training and workshops that brought together Twitter, Google and Facebook alongside other civil society groups. These events focused on technology, civil society, and social platforms' roles in informing the public about the importance of being counted and ensuring a coordinated response across all partners and stakeholders.</p>

        <p><b>It also resulted in a commitment to combat fraudulent activities to help protect the integrity of the 2020 Census — which included preventing the spread of fake, false, and inaccurate information that can negatively influence the 2020 Census.</b></p>

        <div id="callout-text-6" class="callout-image-description"><span>As a result, big tech companies&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;developed and implemented policies&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;that prohibited the sharing of false&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;information about civic events such as&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;the 2020 census on their platforms. </span></div>

        <p>Additionally, Google developed a Google Ads Playbook for civil society groups which helped them coordinate outreach and communication efforts. Since then, the U.S. Census Bureau has established the government’s first-ever Trust & Safety Team to help protect the population's count.</p>

        <p>Census Accelerate has partnered with Code for America, a technology non profit, and their Brigade Network to coordinate on supporting their local communities on the 2020 Census. The Brigade Network is a large network of community organizations, developers and designers within the Code for America network that seeks to put technology forward in service of local communities, a Brigade Network. These convenings included a:</p>

  	    <p>✓	Brigades for the Count webinar for local census committees Complete Count Committees to connect with local Code for America Brigades, so that local volunteer technologists could team up with local advocates to support 2020 Census efforts.</p>

        <p>✓	A second convening with Code for America, New America, and U.S. Census Bureau staff  about potential brigade activations, including supporting Complete Count Committees with digital tools and flagging content that may communicate inaccurate or false information about the 2020 Census at a local level. </p>

        <h3>Powered by the Community</h3>

        <p>In February 2018, The Census Accelerate team developed Census Solutions Workshops  and  Create-a-thon toolkits, offering a step- by- step guide for national and community partners to host their own events. The toolkit was distributed through the U.S. Census Bureau partner websites National Partnerships Program (NPP) and Community Partnerships and Engagement (CPEP and downloaded over 1000+ times. Both organizations adopted the workshop model and deployed the Create a thon event and Census solutions workshop in every Census region-  Making these the Accelerate human -centered design thinking program models U.S. Census Bureau engaged and activated partners for the 2020 Census. </p>

        <p>By the end of 2019, Census community partners, Complete Count Committees, and communities started adopting the Census Solutions Workshop model and Create-a-thons all over the nation.  Census Accelerate developed a guide for facilitators in and outside the Census Bureau to run these design thinking workshops in their various regions. To date, hundreds of Create a thon  and Census solutions workshops have been instituted, resulting in thousands of new ideas and partnerships to support a complete and accurate count for the 2020 Census.</p>

        <h3>Community-Led Outreach</h3>

        <p>In 2017 Census Accelerate partnered with the Office of Evaluation Sciences at General Services Administration to develop an Audience Outreach Toolkit to go hand-in-hand with the Census Solutions Workshop resources and materials. The goal was to help partners create a tailored outreach strategy to reach their communities more effectively.</p>

        <p>The Audience Outreach Toolkit Applies evidence-based practices that help partners identify barriers to participation, gather insights about what works and what doesn’t, and come up with recommendations and questions to reflect on when developing and tailoring communication strategies with a qualitative frame of mind.</p>

        <h3>Going Virtual: Adapting to a Changing Environment</h3>

        <p>The Census Accelerate team piloted the Create-a-thon model over the course of 2018 - 2020, with in-person events that ranged in length from two to five hours. Participants dove into targeted briefs from local advocacy organizations, connected with a diverse group of civically committed people, and collaboratively generated digital media and compelling messages that spread awareness around the 2020 Census. </p>

        <p>In the beginning of 2020, the world was faced with a complex public health environment, changing the way people conducted their everyday lives. This forced Census Accelerate to act rapidly and ensure that relevant content was still being created, especially during a time where the entire world went virtual. The virtual Create-a-thon model was born. We quickly iterated on our original toolkit model and launched the Virtual Create-a-thon toolkit so our team and partners could continue to develop promotional assets virtually.</p>

      <h2>What's Next</h2>
      <hr>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>As the complete and accurate count of the nation becomes more and more imperative in the coming months, cross sector collaborations and the power of civically engaged coalitions will be more critical than ever before. Census Accelerate sought out to test a new design-thinking model, to activate communities in a non-traditional way, to bring passionate folks from all walks of life together that care deeply about increasing awareness for the 2020 Census- and to work alongside the government in these outreach efforts. </p>

        <p>The Census Accelerate Team has demonstrated how consistent, collaborative efforts can impact a feat as great as the U.S. Census. As the self-response period comes to a close, we are seeing the fruits of  our labor being utilized across the nation as our shareables and video creative are helping to promote the 2020 Census to communities everywhere, our design-thinking models are impacting partners within and outside of the Census Bureau, and our big tech partnerships continue to combat misinformation around the Census online.</p>

         <p>The replicable models we created can continue to benefit other programs, initiatives and surveys of the like. They have allowed for communities to take more ownership of the 2020 Census in what has traditionally been a government down approach. By creating an adaptable model to plug in the creative potential of our nation, and integrating the diversity of talents and trusted voices of a community, more content is available online that is relatable, compelling and effective. The census has become personal and  it has become a necessary agenda item for individual and community advocacy.</p>
