      <p class="the-challenge-subheader">The way the world communicates has changed radically in the last 10 years. Relying solely on traditional print ads and TV campaigns wouldn’t work in our social media savvy society today.  In order to get a complete and accurate 2020 census count, we needed to engage the community directly. In 2017, we expanded our reach, pushed the boundaries and asked creatives and community leaders to join us in co-creating digital content and outreach strategies, in the voice of the people they represent. The challenge of bridging the digital divide between the Census Bureau and hard to count communities around the nation is what birthed the Census Accelerate initiative. </p>

        <p>We are a team of entrepreneurs, designers, technology experts, civic leaders, and storytellers who bring design thinking, cross-sector collaboration, and hyper creativity to ensure everyone is represented in the 2020 Census.</p>

        <p>The census aims to count an increasingly diverse and growing population of about 330 million people in more than 140 million housing units, presenting our team with new challenges and opportunities. This 2020 Census is the first ever “digital-first” census, which means there’s now an option to respond to the census online or by phone, in addition to the traditional paper form. Getting this message out to hard-to-count communities across the nation is critical.</p>

        <p>We knew that in order to communicate the importance of the 2020 census, we needed to engage communities in a truly authentic and interactive way.  We developed the following Theory of Change model to help guide our decision making process as we charted towards a  more complete and accurate 2020 census count.</p>
