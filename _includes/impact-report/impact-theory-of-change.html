      <p class="larger">Our theory of change posits that establishing <b class="bold">deep relationships</b> and <b class="bold">collaborative efforts</b> with industries, organizations, communities and creative professionals leads to <b class="bold">exponentially better solutions</b> than if one organization were to try to solve them on their own.</p>

      <p>Our partners are expert in what they do; to better engage them we must co-design solutions with them rather than prescribe what to do, and we must also bring them together with unlikely partners to develop creative solutions rooted in data and culture.</p>

        <li>Partnering with the entertainment industry and media outlets can magnify and spread information about the importance of being counted with language that resonates with communities.</li>
        <li>Partnering with technology companies can increase the trust in and security of the census and the information that surrounds it, as these organizations can use their platforms to counter disinformation, cybersecurity threats, and other impediments to an accurate count. They can also be a powerful catalyst for getting people to respond. </li>

      <p>Through our workshops, open source briefs, and national creative efforts we were able to bring together cross-sector collaborators with diverse perspectives to strengthen civic engagement. In fact, during our first-ever video prize challenge we galvanized the creation of over 750 videos promoting the census. And developing strong, replicable models for collaboration has been key to scaling them. That’s what we did with our Create-a-thon series, Creatives for the Count. We made this workshop model available to the public and grew it exponentially thanks to the Bureau's partnerships teams as well as externally-organized Complete Count Committees.</p>

      <p>Bringing together creative professionals, national advocacy organizations, and local leaders amplified trusted voices in hard-to-count communities and resulted in stronger messages than with top-down messaging coming from the Census Bureau alone. These messengers -- whether they be local faith leaders, celebrities who have strong influence in hard-to-count communities, or advocacy organizations,  are key in spreading information about the importance of being counted with language that resonates with communities.</p>
